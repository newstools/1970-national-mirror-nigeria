For this special child we prayed and God heard us and granted our request. Despite Covid-19, God gave me a birthing experience worth sharing, testimonies back to back from when we found out we were expecting up until the day we gave birth to this harbinger of wealth, favour and all things good. Dear God thank you, a thousand tongues is truly not enough Lord🙏🏽🙏🏽 Thank you dear family and friends for standing with us throughout❤❤❤ We’re so happy for them! Congratulations!
