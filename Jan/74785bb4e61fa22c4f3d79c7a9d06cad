 Former Big Brother Naija star, Ike throws shade at his former girlfriend, Mercy Eke in a recent interview. Ike has revealed that his happiest moment in life was after his last relationship ended. The reality TV star made this known via his Instagram page on Sunday, April 18, 2021, during a chat with SpiceTV Africa. “I am usually very particular about the relationship advise I give because I don’t like to give advise on something I’m not an expert on. I had a couple of girlfriends but my best advise right now is guys, just make sure you are happy because a relationship involves a lot of work and sacrifice,” he said. “Don’t jump into it until you are ready, trust me. A real relationship only works when you have the right partner. My happiest moment in life was when I got out of my last relationship,” he continued Ike’s comments come a few days after reality TV star, Mercy Eke warned fans about dwelling on their failed relationship. “I’m in a happy place, he is good, he is living up, I’m good, I’m living up and I think we should just put an end to this. Stop flooding my timeline with this silly question. We are over. So let’s just keep it moving, we are done,” she said.
