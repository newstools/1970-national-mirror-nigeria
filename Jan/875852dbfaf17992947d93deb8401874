 Former Nigerian Super Eagles striker, Nwankwo Kanu has revealed how he struggled during the start of his illustrious career. He made this known when he spoke at a recent function on #EndSARS organised by the Ebonyi State Government. The post he made reads; When Papilo started, I did not depend on the government. I did not have boots to play football,” the former Arsenal forward said during the event held in Abakaliki. I walk from my house, five kilometres to go to school. Come back from school, help mom, my parents, head out again – another seven kilometres – to play football without boots. At the end of the day, I did not give up. I had belief and I trusted in God that I would make it.
