For over 10 years, you guys have been my world. I honestly owe so much to this world we have created here,” the TV personality, cookbook author and former model tweeted Wednesday night. “But it’s time for me to say goodbye. This no longer serves me as positively as it serves me negatively … I’ve always been portrayed as the strong clap back girl but I’m just not.” “My desire to be liked and fear of pissing people off has made me somebody you didn’t sign up for, and a different human than I started out here as! Live well, tweeters.”
