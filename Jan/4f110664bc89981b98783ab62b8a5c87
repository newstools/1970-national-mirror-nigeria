 Relegation threatened Fulham approach this West London derby seeking their first triumph over Chelsea since March 2006, with a dismal competitive H2H record since (D7, L12). They have lost their last three home clashes vs the ‘Blues’ in succession, of which two saw them trail at HT after conceding exactly two first-half goals, but will be buoyed after finally snapping a run of 13 straight Premier League defeats versus capital clubs with a draw at Spurs on Wednesday. However, those lost first halves stand as anomalies in a wider sequence of league clashes across all venues, with ten of the last 12 producing under 1.5 first-half goals. Across the five first halves therein yielding a 1-0 scoreline for/against Fulham (HT: W1, L4), the ‘Cottagers’ recovered just one point of a possible 12 from the four first halves lost (FT: D1, L3). In practice, this means that Chelsea have taken full points (after second halves producing under 1.5 total goals) from the last three ‘SW6’ rivalry clashes to see them lead at HT. Furthermore, Chelsea are the last team to turn around a HT deficit to a winning end in this fixture, with the title-winning squad of 2009/10 claiming that distinction. On a more sobering note, a return of just one victory in six league games (W1, D1, L4) has severely dented Chelsea’s title hopes. Yet, their status as comfortable pre-match favourites makes it worth remarking that they have averaged exactly 2.0 goals per game beyond the hour mark across their last six PL victories.
