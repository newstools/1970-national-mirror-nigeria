I was going astray, but you supported me with everything in 2020. You [Zlatan], Olamide, Poco Lee and Papisnoop. I was going astray when you found me and helped me. I was smoking and drinking nonsense, but you helped me.” He then went on to say this in Yoruba: “Papisnoop always kept me on my toes. He’s like a Big Brother who never have me a chance to go astray. I started 2020 on a wild note, but I ended it with ‘Cash App’ while cashing out. I can’t believe it but I’m grateful.” 2020 saw Shmurda rise to fame following his hit song ‘Cash App’. He became one of Nigeria’s hottest artists over night after releasing his EP, High Tension and also appearing on songs with Davido and Olamide.
