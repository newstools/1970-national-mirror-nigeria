 Ex-Super Eagles defender Yisa Sofoluwe has died at the Lagos University Teaching Hospital (LUTH). He was aged 53 years. While most reports suggest that the former Nigeria international died of brain-related illness, a close family source declared that Sofoluwe actually died of complications from COVID-19. In an emotional post late Tuesday night, the respected journalist wrote: â€œBroda Yisa, you struggled all through life. Recalled you were harassed many times by landlords. I knew you struggled to survive and stay alive but it wasnâ€™t as easy as we think. How do we console your darling wife, Auntie Busola and the children? ðŸ˜¢ Spoke with her yesterday evening and she was strong and we believed you will pull through only to hear you had gone. ðŸ˜¢ This is sad Dean. You are such a simple, humble, gentle and peaceful person since you knew me as a little boy in your days at Abiola Babes. Once in a while, I monster courage to address by your nicknames â€˜Dean of Defenceâ€™ or â€˜Otoboâ€™. So I will have to delete your phone number. But bros we spoke about two week ago and there was no inclination of brain desease. You asked for a certain number which I gave to you. Never knew that was the last time I will hear your voice.ðŸ˜¢ Oh my God, this is too much for all of us to bear. ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜¢ COVID-19 is real ðŸ˜¢ Sofoluwe had 40 appearances for the national team in which he scored once. He was a member of the Eagles squads which reached the final of the 1984 and 1988 AFCON tournaments. Sofoluweâ€™s death is coming few days after another former Nigeria International Joe Erico was buried in Lagos after his painful death also. Post Views:
