Even though the challenges at the moment appear enormous, Prince Secondus urged Nigerians not to despair but to use this period to meet Jesus who has the magic wand for an answer “In a Yuletide like Christmas, we are provided the ample opportunity to seek and meet the messiah with our needs and desires,” the statement read in part.
