 Forgotten Super Eagles forward Anthony Nwakaeme has blasted national team coach Genort Rohr over lack of second chance with the three-time African Champions. The 31-year-old Nigeria international made his long-awaited debut on 10 November 2017 during the 1-1 scored with Algeria in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. However, Trabzonspor star Nwakaeme said he deserved to make a further appearance for Super Eagles after he featured 71 minutes only for Rohr side.  The Lagos-born attacker said in a TV interview via Score Nigeria: “If I had played in England or Spain instead of Israel, they would have given another chance. Because I played in Israel, the national team coach Rohr looked down on me,” Nwakaeme has continued to shine in Turkish Super Lig after 25 goals in 74 appearances in all competition for Trabzonspor after in his last two seasons. Former Hapoel Be’er Sheva striker has netted six goals and provided five assists as Trabzonspor stay in contention for the Turkish Super Lig title. Post Views:
