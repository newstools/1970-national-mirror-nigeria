 Jack Dorsey Twitter’s chief executive Jack Dorsey has unfollowed Donald Trump’s personal account just a few weeks ahead of the inauguration of president-elect Joe Biden. The social media platform has said it handled account far more leniently than that of any other Twitter user, because it was in the public interest to see what the president of the United States was saying. Despite this, the unfollowing is not likely to be connected to any such ban. Mr Dorsey has also unfollowed Ivanka Trump, Joe Biden, and even Kamala Harris according to @bigtechalert, an account that tracks Silicon Valley executives.
