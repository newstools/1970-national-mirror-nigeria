 Carlo Ancelotti’s Everton will get the chance to go second – even if temporarily – on New Year’s Day with a home win against West Ham and our partners Betpay is bringing you the preview and betting tips. Boxing Day victory at Sheffield United handed them their fourth straight Premier League (PL) win for the second time this season – the last time they achieved such a feat was during their top-flight winning campaign of 1986/87! Those recent good results have been built on a defence that hasn’t conceded more than a single goal in six PL matches, or conceded over 3.5 shots on target in any of the previous five league matches. The ‘Toffees’ left it late at Bramall Lane, yet they are usually at their most dangerous in the first half. They’ve scored 61.54% of their league goals before HT and consequently have trailed at the break just twice (HT: W7, D6, L2). They’re yet to score a home league goal inside the opening 15 minutes though, but have conceded twice in this segment. West Ham United have made their best start after 16 PL matches since the 2015/16 campaign, although they have won only one of their previous six league matches (W1, D3, L2), and conceded the opener before HT in four of those six. Additionally, there were only four sides with a higher goals conceded average than theirs of 1.67 during that six-game sequence. The ‘Hammers’ have drawn a blank in three of their previous four PL visits to Goodison Park (W1, L3) and face an Everton side here that has the benefit of three extra rest days. West Ham have also conceded exactly one goal before HT in their last three competitive games here. Odds Everton have 2.10 odds on them to win this, while West Ham have 3.70 with a draw coming at 3.80 odds on Betpay. Betting Tip Everton are favourites here against a very decent West Ham side and out tipsters have put this one for an Everton win or a draw which comes with 1.24 odds on Betpay and you can stake on that now. Prediction Everton 3-1 West Ham
