 Enyimba striker Tosin Omoyele has reacted after the South Africa team Orlando Pirates earn bragging right in Soweto with a 2-1 win at the Orlando Stadium in a matchday two CAF Confederations Cup clash played on Wednesday evening. Deon Hotto gave Orlando Pirates the lead in the 27th minute after the new Super Eagles invitee John Noble parried the ball from Linda Mntambo. Enyimba were awarded a penalty late in the first half after Siyabonga Mpontshane fouled Anayo Iwuala inside the box but Austine Oladapo made no mistake as he superbly tucked the ball into the net. The Bucs, though, were relentless, and in the 76th-minute, the home side won a penalty and the chance to retake the lead after Mhango was adjudged to have been fouled in the box. But Mabasa sent the resultant spot-kick over the bar as Enyimba heaved another sigh of relief. However, Omoyele took his Instagram handle to reacts to the painful defeat in South Africa. The win lifts Orlando Pirates past Enyimba to the top of the group with four points from two matches. The NPFL champions will host Algerian club ES Setif in their next game on Thursday, April 1st at the Enyimba International Stadium, Aba. Post Views:
