 Member of the House of Representatives representing Sabon Gari federal constituency, Garba Datti-Babawo has revealed reasons for presenting the bill before the National Assembly to reduce the minimum wage. In his description, most state governments could not afford the new 30,000 naira minimum wage to their workers which may lead to of retrenching workers if they were to pay. He said: “Since it has been changed to 30,000 naira, you will find out that most of the states could not pay until the federal government intervened by giving them bailouts to pay. Now that there is no bailout, they cannot pay and most of the states are threatening to retrench most of their workers if they have to pay the 30,000 naira,” “What we are saying is that we should allow them to negotiate what they can pay based on their own resources because the money that goes to the federal government is not the same that goes to the state governments. Even among states, their resources are not the same.
