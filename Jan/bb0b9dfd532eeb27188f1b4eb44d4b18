Ben Murray-Bruce is remembering Evelyn, his late wife, who died after battling cancer.
The former senator representing Bayelsa East took to Twitter on Saturday to share some photos of himself and Evelyn, who breathed her last on March 20, 2020. He shared pictures of his intimate moments with Evelyn, including a photo of himself beside her grave. “She was faithful, loyal, and true. My best friend of 43 years and my wife for 41 years,” the entertainment mogul wrote. “She was one of life’s greatest inspirations to me. Today marks one year since I lost my favourite woman. We miss you, Evelyn Murray-Bruce. The void remains that can never be filled.” See post below, She was faithful, loyal and true. My best friend of 43 years and my wife for 41 years.
