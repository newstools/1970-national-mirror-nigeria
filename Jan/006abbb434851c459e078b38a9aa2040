 Super Eagles forward Peter Olayinka grabbed an assist against Joe Aribo’s Rangers as Samuel Chukuweze impresses in Villarreal win in the last 16 of the UEFA Europa League on Thursday night.  Slavia Prague got off to a perfect start when Olayinka served up the ball for Nicolae Stanciu with the midfielder doing plenty of the work as he fired home from the edge of the box to give them a 1-0 lead. Nine minutes before halftime, Filip Helander tapped the ball into an open net from close range to equalise for Rangers after a free-kick. Czech international winger Masopust replaced Olayinka at the interval after the Nigerian suffered an injury, while Aribo who saw 84 minutes of action before replaced Kemar Roofe.  Chukwueze started Villarreal as they put one foot into the quarterfinals stage following a 2-0 over Dynamo Kyiv at Dynamo Stadium. The 21-year-old Super Eagles winger started on the right side of a front three formation with Spain international Pau Torres put the La Liga outfit ahead 30th minutes into the encounter. However, former Napoli and Real Madrid defender Raul Albiol made it 2-0 seven minutes after the restart to seal a comfortable first-leg win for the Spanish side who go into next week’s return leg with plenty of confidence. Chukwueze featured for 84 minutes before he was replaced by Jaume Costa. Post Views:
