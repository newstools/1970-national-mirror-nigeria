 A 13-game unbeaten Premier League (PL) run (W10, D3) has made Manchester United firm title contenders, although they’ve done it the hard way so far, picking up seven of their 12 PL wins this term after conceding first. However, that never-say-die attitude appears hard-wired into their DNA as their 2-1 comeback win over Fulham in their last top-flight game was a PL-record 94th match that Man United have won after conceding first. Expect a confident home side after Man United knocked Liverpool out of the FA Cup in their last game, even if they scraped by via just a one-goal margin – as has been the case in their last four competitive home wins. Slim margins or not, seven straight top-flight H2H home victories indicates they should beat basement-side Sheffield United here. That seems especially so considering Sheffield travel here as the first top-flight team since 1902/03 to lose 16 of their opening 19 games. A league-low average of 0.53 goals scored per fixture this term further underlines how poor the ‘Blades’ have been. That average reduces to just 0.25 across their last four PL road trips (D1, L3) – the same average they’ve managed at Old Trafford during the PL era. With that being the case, Sheffield look likely to increase on their five HT/FT away defeats this PL campaign.
