 Eucharia Anunobi Popular Nollywood actress and evangelist, Eucharia Anunobi has disclosed that she did not mourn the death of her son because of her faith in the word of God which gives hope in all circumstances. Eucharia Anunobi was hit with the demise of his son, who died after long battle with sickle cell anaemia in 2017. In an exclusive interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, the veteran thespian indicated when one dies, it is only the body that is going but the spirit and soul have returned to the one who gave it and she will reunite with him someday. In her words: “When you grow in God, it makes you understand that everything is temporal, so there is no need killing yourself. If you lose a loved one, the body is what is gone. The spirit and soul have returned to the one who gave it, and you’ll still have a connection with that spirit someday. “The comfort I have not to mourn overtly over the loss of my only child is that I know he is not gone. He’s gone physically, but the word of God says I will see him again.” “That is why the word says, ‘My peace I give to you. My peace I leave with you. Not as the world will give to you.’ Therefore, when you have a bereavement, when you have things that are supposed to bring you undue sorrow, you don’t sorrow. Because you know that they were given to you for a short period of time.” “If you become a child of God, in-depth, you’ll grow to that level when you’re not bothered … over things that are temporal.”
