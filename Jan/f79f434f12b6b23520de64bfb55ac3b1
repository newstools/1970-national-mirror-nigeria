 Ousmane Dembele returned from injury to equalises as Barcelona drop points at home to Eibar without Lionel Messi after a 1-1 scored draw at Nou Camp on Tuesday night. Martin Braithwaite missed a penalty in the first half before Eibar stunned their hosts by taking a 57th-minute lead through striker Kike Garcia. Ousmane Dembele equalised 10 minutes later, steering in a first-time shot. Braithwaite had a chance to win it for the hosts but bundled wide from close range. Messi, who is recovering from an ankle problem, watched the game from the stands, having arrived back from Argentina earlier on Tuesday. The point leaves Barcelona sixth in La Liga while Eibar are 14th, two points clear of the relegation zone.
