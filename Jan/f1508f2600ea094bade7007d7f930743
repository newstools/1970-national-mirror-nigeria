 Abike Dabiri-Erewa Boss of NIDCON, Abike Dabiri-Erewa has come out to rubbish claims that her Twitter handle announced the recovery of the abducted Katsina boys. In a tweet she made on her official Twitter page, Abike revealed that she lost control of her handle hence Nigerians should disregard any tweet earlier made in relation to the issue from her handle. According to her, her Instagram and Twitter handle noted that she has been able to regain access to her accounts and have changed the password respectively. Pls don’t credit any post on katsina boys to my twitter handle. I lost control of my handle in the last couple of minutes, along with my Instagram. I have recovered and changed my password — Abike Dabiri-Erewa (@abikedabiri) December 17, 2020
