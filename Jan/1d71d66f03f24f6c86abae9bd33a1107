 Thomas Tuchel’s unbeaten run stretched to 12 games as Chelsea were held to a 0-0 goalless draw with Leeds United another clean sheet in the Premier League encounter at Elland Road on Saturday afternoon. Despite lacking fans to add edge, both sides were unlucky not to score as they both hit the woodwork and tested their respective keepers. Leeds almost went behind when Luke Ayling’s clearance hit team-mate Diego Llorente and looped over keeper Illan Meslier to hit the bar before Eduoard Mendy tipped Tyler Roberts’ chip onto the same part of his goal. Mendy also saved well from Raphinha’s effort to deny Leeds, who avoided a third straight defeat. Kai Havertz wasted two good chances for the visitors as his Premier League goal drought continued, but he impressed overall in an advanced role. While Tuchel will be disappointed his side did not claim victory to move about third-placed Leicester, his side were given a stern test. And his run of 10 Premier League games unbeaten since the start of a new managers’ reign is second only to Nottingham Forest’s Frank Clark and Chelsea’s Maurizio Sarri. Leeds, who have only won one of their last six games, were dealt a blow in the first half when they lost top scorer Patrick Bamford, on his 100th appearance for the club, to injury in front of the watching England boss Gareth Southgate.
