 Manchester United were ruthless on Friday night as their U-23 squad hammered Blackburn U-23 6-4 during the premier league 2 match. New signing from Atlanta, Amad Diallo was in devastating form as he provided three assists and a goal while Shola Shoretire scored a hat-trick against the league leaders. Amad made his Manchester United debut last week, scoring two goals and made an immediate impact in his second game when his pass into Shola was squared into Mejbri Hannibal and the French youngster made no mistake with his finish to cancel out Blackburn’s opener. United again, threw level after going behind when a glorious pass from Hannibal found Amad and he played in Shola for an easy finish. Blackburn raced to a 4-2 lead early in the second half but Amad inspired a turnaround with an assists for Shola’s goal before Joe Hugill’s header made it 4-4.
