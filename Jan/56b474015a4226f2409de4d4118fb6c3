 Former Chelsea star Glen Johnson has named two big signings Tomas Tuchel need to challenge Manchester City for the Premier League title next season. The 47-year-old German coach has gone on an eight-game unbeaten run and two goals conceded in eight games to get his career in west London underway. Tuchel has helped Chelsea narrow the gap on fourth-placed West Ham in the race for a Champions League spot but former PSG will be handed significant funds to invest his squad this summer, having joined the Blues too late into the January transfer window to add any new recruits. Johnson believes the side are increasingly dependent upon the veterans and Tuchel should address the situation in the summer by finding younger replacements for the pair.  Former Chelsea, Liverpool and English defender to Metro.co.uk: “I think they need a top, younger centre half and they need a top striker. “Obviously they’ve spent a lot of money in the wide areas and in midfield. I think they’re a far better side with Giroud and he’s the guy that they’ve been trying to get out of the door for the last few years. It shows you that they’ve tried to replace him and haven’t managed to do so. “I think a top striker is the main thing. Giroud is 34 now so there’s only so much he can do. The same stands at centre-half because Thiago Silva is a different class but his body can’t cope with the Premier League every week. “I think someone like Haaland would be ideal,’ said Johnson. ‘He’d be the perfect replacement for Giroud. He’s big, he’s quick, he’s powerful, he’s unbelievable in front of a goal. “Those sort of signings give a lift to the rest of the dressing room and it would be a real statement if they could pull it off.’ Frank Lampard embarked on a £225m spending spree last summer but notable signings such as Kai Havertz and Timo Werner struggled to hit the ground running at Stamford Bridge.
