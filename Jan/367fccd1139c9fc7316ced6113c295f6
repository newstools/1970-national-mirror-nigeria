 Super Eagles latest position for New Year FIFA Ranking has been revealed ahead of final 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers in March. Gernot Rohr side dropped one spot to 35th places in the latest rankings released by the world football governing body after ending 2020 as the 34th best nation in the world and fourth-ranked nation in Africa. Super Eagles gain 1474 points to drop to the fifth in Africa behind Senegal, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco after failing to beat Sierra Leone in November 2020 which ended 4-4 and 0-0 respectively. The three-time African champions played four matches in 2020, but they failed to win any of the games, which contributed to their fall in recent rankings. 🇧🇪🔝🌍 🤔 Can anyone knock @BelRedDevils off the summit of the #FIFARanking? — FIFA.com (@FIFAcom) February 18, 2021 There was no change among the top 32 as Belgium still lead the table in 2021 followed by France, Brazil, England and Portugal hold the second, third, fourth and fifth positions.
