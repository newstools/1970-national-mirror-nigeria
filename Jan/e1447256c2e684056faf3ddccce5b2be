In an interview with GuardianLife, she spoke about the selection journey. She said the audition styles were different, but it was worth it. “I must start by giving the credit to Melissa Adeyemo, she was the producer of this film. I had my first meeting with Chuko. He was very particular about the talent that he wanted on the film, and he wanted us to dig and find. I can say that Eyimofe is very demanding for me, which is a good thing because the directors and the producers would not settle for less, so even if I say ‘this would be good’, they will say ‘let us dig further’”. Keep up the good work Kemi.
