 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Bukayo Saka returned to Arsenal training ahead of the Tuesday Premier League clash against Wolves at Molineux Stadium. The 31-year-old Gabon international has missed Gunners’ last three games including a goalless draw against Manchester United on Saturday at Emirate Stadium, due to family personal issues.

However, Aubameyang and Saka were seen in Arsenal training at London Colney on Tuesday evening ahead of the Premier League encounter against Wolves.
