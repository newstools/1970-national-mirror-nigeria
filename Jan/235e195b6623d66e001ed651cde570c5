 Bashir Magashi This disclosure came on Sunday, 13th December when he led a delegation of the Federal Government as well as the service chiefs to Katsina to commiserate with the parents and teachers of the students. He said; “Today, we are here also to symphathise with you over the recent abduction of secondary school students which is more or less a ruthless exercise conducted to tamper with the education of the students. With the brief we received from the sister security agencies in the state, this task will be very simple to accomplish. Within the next few hours, we will ensure that these people are back without any collateral damage to the people of Katsina State. We have strategised.”
