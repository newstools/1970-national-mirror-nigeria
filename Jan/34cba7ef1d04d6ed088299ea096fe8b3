 President Muhammadu Buhari (Source: Presidency) President Buhari has pleaded with his fellow Nigerians to give him some space and have it in mind that his government is working pretty hard to tackle insecurity in the nation. Buhari engaged state house correspondents shortly after observing the Eid prayer, marking the end of the month-long Ramadan fast. According to him, the law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that they can go back to the land and win the confidence of the people. In his words: “With the resources and manpower available to us, we are working very hard. We are hoping Nigerians will underst and the problem. Nigerians know at what stage we came in 2015, what state we are today both on security and the economy and we are doing our best. The law enforcement agencies are working hard to regain confidence against the bandits, so that we can go back to the land. This is very important. This is what the agencies are busy doing right now. We want people to go back to the land so that we can get enough food for the country and even export” “I expect Nigerians to be more understanding on the issues involved, looking at the time and available resources. For example, when we came in, in the Northeast, ask people in Adamawa and Borno States and the South-South in terms of security. Without security, you can’t do anything. Our big surprise and disappointment is what is happening in the Northwest and we are dealing with it”
