 Known as one of the fastest growing interior design companies in Nigeria, Oak and Teak has launched the Oak and Teak Foundation to carry out its corporate social responsibility initiatives with a primary focus of addressing gaps in educational and healthcare sectors in Nigeria as well as other African countries. The founders, Mr. Abayomi @yomimol and Mrs. Morenike Molehin @morenikemolehin, have emphasised that the Foundationâ€™s critical objective would be to ensure that a select group of dilapidated schools and health centres are renovated and restored. With 3 schools and 2 hospital projects already in the works, Oak and Teak Foundation is hitting the ground running and is set to make tangible impact in the nearest future.
