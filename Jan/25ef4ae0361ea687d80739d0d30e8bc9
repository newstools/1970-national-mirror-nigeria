 The police in the federal capital territory (FCT) summoned Ahmad Isah, a human rights activist and broadcast journalist, for slapping a woman who allegedly assaulted a child. Isah, popularly called ”ordinary president”, hosts a long-running radio and television programme known as ”Brekete Family”. He came under public scrutiny after he was seen in a BBC Africa Eye documentary slapping a lady who was accused of setting her brother’s daughter on fire over a witchcraft allegation. Confirming his arrest by the police in a Twitter post, the organisation said: “Ordinary President, Founder and CEO of Brekete Radio and TV program honoured an invitation to the FCT Police Command this morning. “We want the public to know that we are yet to see or reach him.” However, he was later released. No details were given on what transpired while he was with the police.
