 Guys, it’s finally happening. Vector and M.I. Abaga have teamed up on a single titled “Crown of Clay“, and it seems the track will premiere alongside its music video. Vector made the surprise announcement on his Twitter page, by sharing a photo of himself and M.I., telling fans to turn on their post notifications. The photo shared shows both rappers dressed like kings, sitting on a throne, with wide smiles. He wrote; “You know what to do to your post notification. #CROWNOFCLAY”. We honestly can’t wait to listen to the forthcoming track. So guys, like Vector said, turn on your notification. You know what to do to your post notification. ❤️🐍❤️#CrownOfClay pic.twitter.com/dv6TXLbDmN — T.E.S.L.I.M (@VectorThaViper) February 25, 2021
