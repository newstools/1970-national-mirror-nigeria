 Former Super Eagles forward, Odion Ighalo will be hoping to get a rare opportunity for a start when Manchester United travels to Goodison Park to face Alex Iwobi’s Everton in the quarter-final of the Carabao Cup on Wednesday. The 31-year-old who is on loan from Chinese Super League side, Shanghai Shenhua has made two appearances in the competition so far against Brighton and Luton Town. After training on Monday, Ighalo wrote on his official twitter handle: “We Don’t Stop When We Are Tired, We Stop When We Are Done Smiling face with heart-shaped eyes. The Grind Continues. #ighalo #mufc #ggmu.” Ighalo has made only three appearances in all competitions this season and he is yet to register any goal so far. The Nigerian scored three times in the Carabao Cup last season as Manchester United reached the semifinal stage. Iwobi on the other hand has enjoyed a fantastic start to the season and was heavily involved for the Toffees as they picked back-to-back impressive victories over Chelsea and Arsenal in the premier league. The former Gunner star will hope to get revenge over Man United after the Red Devils defeated them 3-1 during a premier league match. Interestingly, there is no extra time in the Carabao Cup this season and games that finish level after 90 minutes will go straight to penalties.
