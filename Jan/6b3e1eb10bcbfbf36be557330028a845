Show host Frank Edoho has replied to a fan who asked him to replace his colleague Ebuka as the host of this season’s BBNaija reality show. The fan who seems tired of seeing Ebuka as the host of BBNaija for 3yrs suggested that Frank Edoho who has been a show host for 13yrs should replace Ebuka. Frank Edoho replying to that asked what Ebuka has done to the fan for him/her to make such a suggestion as he rubbishes the idea. He then asked if he has hosted a show for 13yrs, why can’t Ebuka be allowed to host BBNaija also the same 13yrs when the fan tried to twist his words. There has been a call on Twitter for BBNaija organizers to get Ebuka a co-host or change him totally and the suggested people are Toke Makinwa, Frank Edoho, and Nancy Isime. What did Ebuka do to deserve all this? Why would you want to change  someone that has done a show successfully for only 3 years and have him replaced with one who did WWTBAM for 13 years? Leave Ebuka alone! Please. https://t.co/ZtdLttZNxz — Frank Edoho (@frankedoho) March 26, 2021 No. No. No. That's not what I meant. If I could do mine for 13 years, why shouldn't Ebuka? https://t.co/wOGflB5m9u — Frank Edoho (@frankedoho) March 26, 2021
