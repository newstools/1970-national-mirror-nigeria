 Former Golden Eaglets skipper Kelechi Nwakali has joined another Spanish Spanish Segunda club AD Alcorcon on loan from SD Huesca for the rest of the campaign to save his career. The 22-year-old attacking midfielder came into the limelight after leading Nigeria¬†to lift the 2015 U17 FIFA World Cup. However, Nwakali senior career has failed to kick-off with the Diamond Football Academy graduate struggles for playing games time at Estadio El Alcoraz this season after playing a key role in the club‚Äôs promotion last season. CD Alcorcon confirmed the signing via their club Twitter handle and plus Huesca club website. FICHAJE ‚úç| Kelechi Nwakali es nuevo jugador de la AD Alcorc√≥n.
