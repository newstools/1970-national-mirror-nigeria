 Chad reopened its borders on Wednesday, a day after they were closed following the death in combat of president Idriss Deby Itno, the country’s new transitional military council said. A curfew also imposed after the veteran leader’s death on Tuesday would now start from 8 pm instead of 6 pm, according to a statement signed by the military council’s spokesman Azem Bermandoa Agouna.
