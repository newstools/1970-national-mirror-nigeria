 Nigerian winger Jesse Sekidika has joined another Turkish club Konyaspor after Galatasaray sign Super Eagles forward Henry Onyekuru from AS Monaco. The 24-year-old Port Harcourt-born first-team opportunity would be limited since the arrival of Onyekuru to Türk Telekom Stadium pushed him further down the pecking order of wingers. Sekidika has found game time at Galatasaray by just making 12 appearances with only three starts. Konyaspor made the announcement via the club official Twitter handle after bringing in Sekidika to Konya Büyükşehir Stadium for the remainder of the 2020-2021 season. Sekidika has been handed the number 71 jersey at Konyaspor for the remainder of this season. Post Views:
