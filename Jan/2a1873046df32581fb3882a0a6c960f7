 Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has effected some changes in his squad as the Blues take on Aston Villa in their last game for 2020. Lampard’s decision to ring changes is coming on the heels of his side’s Boxing Day defeat to Arsenal. The Blues lost 3-1 at the Emirates Stadium, their third consecutive Premier League away defeat and Lampard fumed after the game that his side had underperformed, especially in the first half.

Chelsea vs Aston Villa: Preview & Betting Tips “There will be some changes and I knew that anyway,” Lampard said. “I’m certainly not going to bang the drum about the turnaround after our performance (at Arsenal). It’s not an important point. “But to play two games in two days we have to make changes anyway. Some of them will happen now because of how the game went and people will have to come in and inject the energy and the personality of our normal performances. “The reason we went so many games unbeaten was because of that, so we’ve come off that and we must come back on it quickly. Some of it is maybe where we are at as a squad.”  The failure of Chelsea to win at the Emirate denied them the chance of climbing as high as the second position behind Liverpool who also dropped points in their penultimate game of the year.
