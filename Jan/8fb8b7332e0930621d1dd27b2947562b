 Joe Abah Former Director-General of Bureau of Public Sector Reform, Dr Joe Abah has advised Nigerian youths who have the opportunity of traveling abroad to do so and not waste their time. Dr Joe Abah took to his twitter page to detail his first flight outside the country to UK that made him see a clear path. He wrote: Moving abroad the 1st time, I didn’t watch any in-flight movie. My eyes were firmly on the flight display. As soon as we left Nigeria, I made the sign of the Cross. When we left Africa, I whispered “Alleluia! If this plane does emergency landing now, it won’t be in Africa sha! “It’s true that when I got to the UK for the first time, I thought “Is this all?” However, I could see a clear path to how I could own a car, buy a house and build a career. I couldn’t see that path as a young man in Nigeria. I still don’t see it for many young Nigerians now. In your youth, you should japa if you want to and have an opportunity to do so. Get the basics, like a car, a house, a 90-inch TV and a bad bad sound system. Build your CV there & show them you are a determined Naija person. If, later, you want to come back, it’ll be by choice.” In your youth, you should japa if you want to and have an opportunity to do so.
