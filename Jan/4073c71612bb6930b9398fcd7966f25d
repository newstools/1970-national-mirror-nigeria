 Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu Following the spike in number of daily cases of the coronavirus, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu says the Federal Government is planning to postpone the reopening date for schools. Recall that schools were ordered to resume on 18th January by the FG. Adamu gave this update while speaking at the briefing of the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19. He said; “It (January 18th date of school reopening) is not sacrosanct. When we decided on that date it was just a target towards what we were working on. Of course, we are keeping it in view and looking at what is happening in the society and then it is supposed to be subject to constant review. Even today at the PTF meeting we looked at the rising figures and thought about if we should probably take another look at it. On January 18th resumption, we are reviewing it, we are going to review it… tomorrow the Ministry is going to take it up.”
