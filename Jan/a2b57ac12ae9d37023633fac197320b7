 Super Eagles winger Samuel Chukwueze is back to Villarreal training ahead of the Europa League final against Manchester United in six days time. The 21-year-old Nigeria international was stretchered off in Villarreal’s semi-final clash against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium early this month. The club later confirmed he sustained muscular damage to the quadriceps in his left leg but Chukwueze initially expected to be out of action for at least a month, a development which would have ruled him out of their all-important clash against Manchester United. According to the club social media handle former Arsenal transfer target was pictured in training along with his Villarreal’s teammates ahead of Sunday La Liga clash with Real Madrid before the Europa League final against Manchester United next week in Gdansk on Wednesday, May 26.  Chukwueze has scored one goal and provided five assists in 12 appearances in the Europa League this season. Post Views:
