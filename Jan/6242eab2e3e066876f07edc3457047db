 Chelsea won the Champions League title for the second time in their history after defeating Manchester City 1-0 on Saturday. Having won two consecutive matches against Pep Guardiola’s side, Thomas Tuchel’s boys now have a hat-trick of wins against the Cityzens this season. It was a slow start to the game between the two English clubs. Manchester City, however, woke up and began some foray down their left flank in the 29th minute. But a gorgeous Kai Havertz finish broke the deadlock in the 42nd minute. Chelsea were able to contain City in the second half to ensure Havertz’s goal was enough to lay claim to the 2020/21 UEFA Champions League title. After taking Paris Saint Germain to last season’s final, Tuchel became the first coach to take two different clubs to the final in successive seasons. The Blues have now claimed their sixth major European trophy in total. They won the Europa League in 2013 and 2019 while they also emerged winners of the Cup Winners Cups in 1971 and 1998.
