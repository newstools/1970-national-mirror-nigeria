 Davido (Source; Instagram/@davido) Nigerian singer David has warned those who plan to pay anybody else his money and call him to come perform this year that he isn’t doing that anymore. According to him, this year 2021 if you send or give anyone his performance money or any money that belongs to him, note that the person who took the money will come and perform for you. His post made it clear that this year 2021, no one should make the mistake of giving his performance money to anyone because if you do so he won’t be at the venue to perform. See Screenshot below
