 Super Eagles in-form defender Semi Ajayi proved the catalyst for West Brom as they won the Black Country Derby with a 3-2 victory over Wolves and declared his readiness for more after unique headed goals record. New Baggies manager Sam Allardyce continued with the Nigerian in the heart of defence and he repaid the faith with a stellar defensive performance which he capped with a goal to become the player with the highest headed goals in English football with nine goals since the 2018/19 season. Ajayi who has now scored three goals in his last five matches said after the encounter: ‘Hopefully, the goals continue in the next few games.’ He continues: ‘I believe we have improved massively and had the will power to fight for the three 3point, to get the win in a derby is a good one for the boys. I believe in our group and to overcome the deficit is something we hope to take into the next game.’ Matheus Pereira gave West Brom an early lead but two quick goals just before half-time from Fabio Silva and Willy Boly gave the home side a 2-1 lead. Ajayi restored parity with a headed goal to make it 2-2 before another penalty from Pereira sealed the win for Sam Allardyce’s men. West Brom are still stuck in the relegation zone but now have 11 points in 19th with Wolves sit 14th with 22 points. Post Views:
