 Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City take a trip down south to face Southampton this weekend and our partners Betpay brings you the match preview and betting tips. Despite a numerical advantage for 30 minutes against Arsenal in midweek, Southampton could not turn their dominance into a third straight Premier League (PL) win, and temporary charge of the PL table. Still, their season has been phenomenal so far (W7, D3, L3), and although outsiders here, just 46.15% of their league matches this season have seen the matchday favourite triumph. At home they’ve achieved four multi-goal wins ‘to nil’ against relatively weaker opponents and two big defeats against Tottenham and Manchester United that featured 12 goals, and where Southampton conceded seven second-half goals in total. Indeed, Southampton have been sharper in the first halves here, remaining unbeaten and with five HT wins so far. Manchester City, meanwhile, also failed to capitalize from near total domination against West Bromwich Albion in midweek, and had to settle for a draw after a first-half own-goal. It was their fifth draw across their last ten in the league (W4, L1), with four of those seeing a 1-1 final result, and marked the eighth time from 12 matches that they failed to score more than one goal. Away from home, there’s been an extraordinary drought of goals, as five straight competitive matches on the road for City have seen just one or no team score (W2, D2, L1). Those games averaged 0.8 total goals per match and saw the action end early, as only one goal arrived in the second half. Odds Southampton have odds of 5.80 for a win while a Manchester City win is priced at 1.55 and a draw gets 4.75, all on Betpay. Betting Tip Bookies have predicted a draw or a Manchester City win which attracts odds of 1.11 and you can stake on it on Betpay. Prediction Southampton 2-2 Manchester City
