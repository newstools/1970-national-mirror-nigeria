 Frank Lampard’s Chelsea will play their first game of 2021 against Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City at Stamford Bridge and will hope to begin the year with a win and our partners Betpay brings you the preview and betting tips. A return of just one victory in five games (W1, D1, L3) has given Chelsea a huge task as they chase an increasingly-unlikely first league title in four years. The two games won/drawn came at home and saw the ‘Blues’ score first and lead 1-0 at HT. In turn, they have averaged exactly 2.0 goals per game beyond the hour mark across their last six Premier League (PL) victories. Despite being held to a 1-1 draw vs Aston Villa on Dec 28, Chelsea ended the 2020 calendar year averaging 2.18 points per home league game played in 2020. That is up drastically from the 1.32 attained per PL home game in 2019, with eight (72.73%) of the Blues’ 11 home league victories recorded in 2020 producing a 2+ goal margin. Manchester City are undefeated in six PL matches (W4, D2) after scoring the opening goal in five of those six, each time before the 31st minute. Impressively, they’ve now kept 13 clean sheets in all competitions this season, which was more than any other team across Europe’s top five divisions on the day of their postponed match vs Everton. In addition to losing both halves 1-0 on their last league trip to London, the visitors were beaten in their last visit here (2-1) going down to a penalty goal after losing the first half 1-0. Overall their ten-game PL form at Stamford Bridge is poor (W2, D2, L6), with the decider scored in the first half in two of the last four defeats. Odds Chelsea are priced at 2.90 odds for a win and a draw is priced at 3.75 with a Manchester City win being priced at 2.40 odds on Betpay. Betting Tip Neither side has been in great form and it looks like a game that will produce a winner from either side and that attracts odds of 1.24. Also, our tipsters have predicted for both sides to score and that comes with odds of 1.65 on Betpay. Prediction Any side to win and both teams to score
