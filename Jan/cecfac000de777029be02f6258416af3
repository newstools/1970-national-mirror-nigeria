 Breaking records and winning silverware is the hallmark of Cristiano Ronaldo and the Portuguese achieved both Wednesday night in the Italian Super Cup final clash against Napoli. Ronaldo has officially become the highest-scoring football player in history, after scoring his 760th career as Juventus beat Napoli 2-0 in the Super Cup contest. Ronaldo’s goal means he now move clear of legendary Austria-Czech footballer Josef Bican who is on 750 goals. The Portuguese put Juve 1-0 ahead in the 64th minute after firing in from six yards from a corner which bounced off Tiemoue Bakayoko. Napoli were handed a lifeline from the penalty spot following a foul on substitute Dries Mertens. But Lorenzo Insigne put his effort wide despite sending Szczesny the wrong way. And in five minutes of added time, Juve then went on the counter from a Napoli corner which Alvaro Morata finished off. Ronaldo while being silent on the new record he is said to have set expressed great delight at the latest trophy collection to his already bulging cabinet. He wrote this on Twitter: Very happy with my 4th title in Italy… We are back! This is the Juve we love, this is the team we trust and this is the spirit that will lead to the wins we want! Well done, guys! Fino Alla Fine! https://twitter.com/Cristiano/status/1352026659445157894 The Italian Super Cup is the traditional clash between the Scudetto and Coppa Italia holders Post Views:
