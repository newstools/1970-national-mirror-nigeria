 Chelsea duo Fikayo Tomori and Tammy Abraham have failed to make Englandâ€™s provisional squad for the European Championship next month. England manager Gareth Southgate drew up 33 names for the upcoming Euro tournament and Tomori and Abraham were left out. Tomori who is on loan at AC Milan was exempted from the list while Ben White who plays for Brighton and Hove Albion made the cut as well as Everton defender Ben Godfrey.

Abraham has seen his playing time limited since the arrival of Thomas Tuchel, the duo is not let alone as the likes of Hudson Odoi (Chelsea), Callum Wilson (Newcastle United), Danny Ings (Southampton), Patrick Bamford(Leeds United), Chris Smalling( AS Roma), Aaron Bassaka (Manchester United), James Maddison (Leicester City).
