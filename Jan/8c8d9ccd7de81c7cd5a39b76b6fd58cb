 Toke Makinwa OAP Toke Makinwa has savagely replied to a man who accused her of lying about the secret of her success and using God as a cover-up which is not right. Toke Makinwa in a tweet appreciated God for turning her painful events and worst moments into a blessing and preparing her for the future making her who she is today. A guy who feels there’s more to what Toke Makinwa said accused her of lying about her secret to success, saying she has broken a lot of rules to be where she is now but is using God as a cover-up. Toke Makinwa replying to that asked the fan to break his own rules to get to the top and use whatever he wants as a cover-up and stop being a spectator so others can talk about him too. I never thought in my Wildest dreams that even the most painful events of my life were blessing me and preparing me for a better future, it may not make sense to you, often times, it doesn’t but he”ll use the foolish things to humble the wisdom of the world — Toke Makinwa (@tokstarr) March 3, 2021 After you people broke rules to be successful you come around like saints to the world and use God has cover up.
