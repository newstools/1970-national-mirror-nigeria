 Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone has revealed that why Manchester City transfer targets Joao Felix must start in a must-win encounter against Chelsea in the second leg Champions League clash on Wednesday night at Stamford Bridge. The La Liga league leader trail the Premier League giant outfit by a goal courtesy of France international Olivier Giroud’s bicycle kick in the first leg in Bucharest last month ahead of the return leg in London. Atletico Madrid will need to take the game to Chelsea as they search for the elusive goal which they need at a minimum to have any chance of progressing through to the last eight of the tournament.  Felix who is an Atletico Madrid record signing has struggled to shine this calendar year to date but boss Diego Simeone insists he will start at Stamford Bridge speaking a pre-match press conference via Football Espana after the Argentina coach confirmed the Spanish club team news. “Joao is going to play from the beginning. “Probably tomorrow is the right day for Luis Suarez to end the streak that you are talking about [goalless away from home in Europe]. Why not? Tomorrow could be a beautiful day. “We will play with both of them to see which one is better for us to be able to win from any minute. “The goal is to improve our situation from the first leg. We don’t know how they will approach it, but I know what we want from the match, which is to win it.” Felix cost Atletico Madrid 126million euros in June 2019 but the Portuguese star scored against Villarreal in the recent league win but that was just his second goal in his last 17 appearances, and he has yet to find his best form at the club.
