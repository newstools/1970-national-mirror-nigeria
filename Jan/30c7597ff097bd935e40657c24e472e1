 Southampton have dumped defending champions Arsenal out of the Emirate FA Cup after a 1-0 win in the fourth round of the tournament on Saturday afternoon at Saint Mary’s Stadium. Southampton come into the game off back-to-back home wins, including over Premier League champions Liverpool, and again host Arsenal in the top-flight in three days’ time. Mikel Arteta has shuffled his pack somewhat, with struggling wingers Willian and Nicolas Pepe afforded another chance to impress, while new signing Mat Ryan is in the squad after he makes the substitute bench. An own goal in the 24th minute by Gabriel was enough to hand the Saints victory, in a tie many have tipped the Gunners to win. The Saints’ press discombobulates the Arsenal defence as the ball’s shuttled out to the right, with Walker-Peters entering the box and firing a shot through Cedric’s legs. Despite several efforts, Mikel Arteta’s men after bringing in Thomas Partey, Alexandre Lacazette and Bukayo Saka Gunners failed to restore parity which saw the FA Cup crash out of the tournament.
