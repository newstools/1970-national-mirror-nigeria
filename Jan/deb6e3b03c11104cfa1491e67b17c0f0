The Nigerian Correctional Service NCoS has launched a probe into Monday’s gun attack on the Owerri Custodial Centre which led to the forceful release of 1, 844 inmates. Spokesman of the NCoS, CC Francis Enobore in a statement explained that “the attackers who stormed the facility at about 0215hrs on Monday 5th April 2021, gained entrance into the yard by using explosives to blast the administrative block”. The attackers were said to have arrived at the centre in large numbers in several Hilux pick-up vans and Sienna Buses armed with sophisticated weapons and immediately engaged the security personnel on duty in a fierce gun battle. “They eventually detonated the explosive to gain entrance”, Enobore stated. He added that the Acting Controller-General of Corrections, John Mrabure has ordered a comprehensive investigation into the incident and in collaboration with other security organizations, commenced a search and recovery operations to recapture the fleeing inmates. “While appealing to the good citizens of Imo State and indeed Nigerians to volunteer useful intelligence that will facilitate the recovery effort, the Ag. Controller-General wishes to assure that the security of custodial centres in the country remains sacrosanct. “He equally directed all officers attached to custodial facilities to remain vigilant at this trying moment in our history.
As at the last count, 6 inmates have so far voluntarily returned to the facility while 35 inmates refused to escape from custody during the attack”. Vanguard News Nigeria
