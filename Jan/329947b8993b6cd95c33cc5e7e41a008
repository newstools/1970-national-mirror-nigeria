 Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez officially called off their two-year engagement, saying in a statement on Thursday April 15, that they “realized we are better as friends.” “We will continue to work together and support each other on our shared businesses and projects,” Lopez and Rodriguez said in a joint statement to NBC’s TODAY Show. “We wish the best for each other and one another’s children. Out of respect for them, the only other comment we have to say is thank you to everyone who has sent kind words and support.” Lopez is the mom of twins Max and Emme, 13, whom she shares with ex-husband Marc Anthony. Rodriguez is the dad to two daughters, Ella, 12, and Natasha, 16. Lopez and Rodriguez started dating in 2017 and announced their engagement in March 2019 while vacationing in the Bahamas. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, they had to postpone their wedding twice.
