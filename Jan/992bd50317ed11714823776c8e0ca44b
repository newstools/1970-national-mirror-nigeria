 Yvonne Jegede Nigerian actress Yvonne Jegede has advised Ugandans to work on their self-esteem issues because it has nothing to do with Nigerians as she shares her experience. According to her, she was in their country to shoot a movie and after every sentence, they will say Nigerians are very proud and she was also labeled as proud of everything she says. Adding that even when she said she never knew any Ugandan artist, she was called proud for not knowing any of their artists which is a fact as most people don’t know their artists. She then advised them to work on their self-esteem issues because it has nothing to do with Nigerians and she’s very proud to be a Nigerian. I was in #Uganda in 2013 to shoot a film, after every sentence came “you Nigerians are very proud”, even when I said I didn’t know any Ugandan artist I was labeled proud. I am proud of where I come from, your self esteem issues has nothing to with Nigerians#FreeTemsAndOmahLay — Yvonne Jegede (@iamyvonnejegede) December 16, 2020
