 Rev. fr. Mbaka Protest turned to jubilation as Rev. Fr Ejike Mbaka was found, shortly after he was declared missing by the Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide (OYC) in Enugu State. Supporters and members of Adoration Ministry in Enugu, where the priest was the Soiritual Director, took to the streets earlier today to protest against Fr. Mbakaâ€™s alleged disappearance. Mbaka had asked President Muhammadu Buhari to resign or be impeached last week and was later dragged on social media by the Presidency, who alleged that the cleric was angry because he sought to secure contracts from the Buhari-led government and was denied. Fr. Mbaka is set to address the press soon.
