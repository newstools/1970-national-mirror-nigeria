 Rev. Fr. William Kosco has vowed never to give US president, Joe Biden holy communion unless he repents. Rev. Fr William Kosco made this pronouncement during mass in his parish in Arizona where he claimed President Joe Biden is a catholic and has supported several vices the catholic faith condemns which include abortion, same sex marriage and others. He also said Biden “is diametrically opposed to all of the basic moral principles that are proclaimed by the Roman Catholic Church”, therefore, he will not give Biden Communion if he attends his Church. “Joe Biden is welcome to come to Mass here; his ideas are not welcome,” Rev. Fr. William Kosco said.
