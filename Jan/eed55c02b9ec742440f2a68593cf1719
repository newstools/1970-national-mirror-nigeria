 Relief has come to telephone users in the country as national telecommunications operator, Globacom, has resumed Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) card activation and replacement at select Gloworld retail outlets across Nigeria. A press statement issued by the company in Lagos over the weekend said this followed the lifting of the suspension of activation of new SIM cards and replacement of lost ones which the Ministry of Communications and Digital Economy had announced last December. Globacom said existing Glo subscribers and those who intend to join the network can now activate a new SIM or replace lost/damaged SIM on the provision of a valid National Identification Number (NIN) which is the new guideline given by the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). “For us, the needs of our customers come first. We are keenly aware of the difficulty the ban had on our existing and prospective subscribers while it lasted and look forward to the respite they will have with the recommencement of SIM activations”, the company said in the statement. “We have already commenced SIM registration and activations in line with the announced guidelines of NCC. All our esteemed customers have to do is to visit the GLO SIM Activation outlet closest to them. A full list of our Glo SIM Activation outlets can be found at www.gloworld.com/ng/sim“, Globacom added. The company had recently equipped its outlets nationwide with requisite facilities to enable Glo subscribers to register for their NIN and link it to their SIMs in an easy and convenient manner in line with NCC’s directive. Globacom also introduced Appointment Manager, an application through which people who wish to register for NIN will be able to choose a day, time, and Gloworld outlet convenient for them to visit for the process.
