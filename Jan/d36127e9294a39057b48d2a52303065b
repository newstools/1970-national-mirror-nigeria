 Wolverhampton Wanderers’ midweek 2-1 Premier League (PL) defeat to Everton was their fifth consecutive winless league game (D2, L3), and also means their last seven competitive matches have produced a different result to the one beforehand (W2, D2, L3). Furthermore, it’s now a concerning 11 league fixtures without a clean sheet (W2, D3, L6) but they are unbeaten when scoring first in the PL this term (W5, D1). It’s therefore worrying that Wolves have conceded the opener in their last five PL home matches (W1, D2, L2), and subsequently four of those witnessed both teams score. Interestingly, there’s been plenty of late action here this term, with eight (61.54%) out of 13 second-half league goals coming after the 75th minute. That should concern late-game strugglers West Bromwich Albion, who’ve conceded 15 league goals after the 60th minute, netting just twice during this period all term. Although their eight-match form (W1, D2, L5) is identical to Wolves, they enter this game as clear outsiders having suffered three defeats ‘to nil’ via at least three-goal margin across their previous four PL games. Given their position in the relegation zone, this would be a good time for the ‘Baggies’ to record a first away league win of the season (D3, L5). Yet whilst this is the first meeting between these Black Country rivals since 2012, somewhat encouragingly, West Brom have won three of their last four games here, scoring an impressive ten times therein. Odds Betpay has Wolves on 1.80 odds to win and 5.75 for a West Brom win while a draw attracts odds of 3.80. Betting Tips Wolves are obvious favourites but West Brom under Sam Allardyce can be as stubborn as they come and the bookies believe they will be a tough nut to crack. However, they believe it will be a Wolves’ win or a draw and Betpay is offering odds of 1.11 for that. Prediction Wolves to win or draw Post Views:
