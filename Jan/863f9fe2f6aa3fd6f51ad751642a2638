Along with being in love, seeing people in love is another feeling thatâ€™s simply top-tier. We most certainly canâ€™t get enough of seeing two lovers stepping up the bar and going on to their forever ship. The beauty of love is all so encompassing and wholesome. ðŸ¤­ Today, our excitement is coming from the adorable couple, TyiaÂ andÂ Cruise. The lovebirds, completely captivated by each otherâ€™s love are taking it up a notch to become one. Their chemistry in this pre-wedding shoot has us feeling all mushy on the inside. Now, when it comes to style, you know we definitely love a stylish couple and Tyia and cruise are serving it to us on a beautiful platter. Tyia came ready to rep in that elegant white dress and Cruise was definitely not lagging behind either. We also canâ€™t get over all the romantic vibes from their beach photos.
