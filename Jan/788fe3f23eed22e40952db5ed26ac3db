 Baba Ijesha Hakeen Odumosu, the Commissioner of Police for Lagos State has stated that Yoruba actor Olanrewaju Omiyinka fondly called Baba Ijesha will be detained till the Judiciary Staff Union of Nigeria suspends the nationwide strike and resumes its operations. Only then, Baba Ijesha would be arraigned for court. His response comes as a counter reaction to the protest Nollywood actor Yomi Fabiyi and others staged on Wednesday, May 12 at the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department, Panti demanding for his release on bail. Hakeem Odumosu also revealed that Baba Ijesha was kept under detention on the basis of legal advice by the Public Prosecutions Directorate at the State Department of Justice and that a prima facie case against him had been created. He said; “When they got the SCIID today (Wednesday), they were advised by the Deputy Commissioner of Police in charge of the SCIID, and he told them that we have done our work and sought legal advice from the Ministry of Justice and the advice was that we should still keep him in our custody. “When we concluded our investigation, we forwarded our report to the ministry for legal advice. The ministry advised us through the Office of the Public Defender. The legal advice was that there was a prima facie case established against him and some sections of the law were quoted in the advice. So, the advice was that he should still remain in our custody and to be charged for that.” In addition, the Chief of Police said that court staff have decided to work three days and resume their strike on the rest of two days of the week, announcing that Baba Ijesha’s continuing arrest will be checked if JUSUN’s strike occurs on an indefinitely basis.
