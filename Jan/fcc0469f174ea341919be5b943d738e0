 The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has rescheduled the commencement of registration for the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE). The report, according to The Nation, indicated that this latest development was due to the inability of candidates to create their profiles. It was also revealed in the report that the exercise which was expected to commence on Thursday, April 8 to Saturday, May 15 is now on hold. As of April 8, most banks were unable to generate the ePin (forms) for candidates and the report further indicated that a Computer Based Test (CBT) centre operator said they were unable to download the application to use for the registration. The operator added that candidates who visited his centre were turned back because of these challenges. Another report by the Daily Nigerian stated that the board while announcing the guidelines for this year’s UTME, made the use of the National Identity Number (NIN) compulsory for the examination. The head of JAMB’s head of media and protocol, Fabian Benjamin has confirmed that the board has seen the challenges surrounding the registration exercise. The reaction from the board reads; ”To be sure all processes are completed before the commencement, the Board didn’t place its advertorial as it was yet to complete the process of a smooth pin vending and candidate access to the registration app for the 2021 UTME/DE. This delay is caused by some unforeseen circumstances occasioned by our determined effort to have a NIN integration. This challenge is being resolved and once that is done, all processes shall commence.”
