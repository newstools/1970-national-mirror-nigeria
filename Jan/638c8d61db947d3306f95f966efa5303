 Napoli manager Gennaro Gattuso has defended the lackluster performance of Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen during Napoli’s 3-1 defeat against Atalanta in the Coppa Italia semifinal second leg. The Italian handed Osimhen his first start against La Dea after three substitute appearances following his return from a shoulder injury and Covid-19 but he failed to deliver as the Azzurri went out on a 3-1 aggregate. “It’s not easy to be at the top of the game after being out for 94 days,” Gattuso told the club website after the encounter. “He’s still lacking that sharpness, which is his main asset, but he’s gradually making progress. He’s capable of much more.” Napoli signed Omeruo for a club-record fee from Lille but the 22-year-old has scored just twice with one assist in 13 appearances across all competitions this season.
