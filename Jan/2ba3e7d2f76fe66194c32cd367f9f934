 Former Super Eagles star Victor Moses has reacted after Man of the Match performance during Spartak Moscow 2-1 win over Arsenal Tula in the Russian Premier League match at the Arsenal Stadion on Monday. The 30-year-old Nigerian forward who currently on loan at Otkrytie Bank Arena from Champions League semi-final list Chelsea set up Aleksandr Sobolev for the opening goal of the game in the 21st minute. Arsenal Tula equalised following Ilya Kutepov’s own goal on the stroke of half-time before Moses teed up Jordan Larsson for the winning goal 14 minutes from time. The former Nigeria international was deservedly handed the Man of the Match accolade (pictured) after his two brilliant assists helped the Muscovites secure a win. Moses now scored three goals and recorded four assists in 17 league appearances for Spartak Moscow this season. Domenico Tedesco’s side occupies the second position on the table with 53 points from 28 games with two games to go against Khimki and Akhmat Grozny. Post Views:
