 Osagie Ehanire The Federal Minister of Health, Dr. Osagie Ehanire has indicated that if Nigeria really wants to tackle malaria and eradicate it, then the country needs not less than N1.89 trillion. He made this known in a recent submission at a news conference in Abuja on April 23 where he explained that of the total sum, the country required more than N350 billion to fight the disease in 2021 alone. He said; “The implementation of the new strategic plan will cost N1.89 trillion; about N352 billion is required for the year 2021 programme implementation.” According to him, the Federal Government of Nigeria does not have the adequate amount required to fight the disease stating that this is because of the difficult economic circumstances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He indicated that the federal government was working to establish a Malaria Council that would help to drive domestic funding for the elimination of the disease. Meanwhile, Nigerian billionaire, Prince Ned Nwoko has launched his Malaria eradication programme. The renowned philanthropist aims to eradicate malaria from the shores of Africa with Nigeria as the starting point. The programme has since been supported by some important dignitaries and in order to create awareness, he travelled to Antarctica making his the first black man to go there.
