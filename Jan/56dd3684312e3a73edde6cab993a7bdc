 Omah Lay And Tems Allegedly Arrested In Uganda Nigerian artists have taken to social media to react to the arrest of Omah Lay and Tems requesting that the Ugandan authorities allow Omah Lay and Tems come back to Nigeria safely. Tems and Omah Lay were arrested two days ago, for holding a concert in Uganda breaching the country’s COVID-19 rules  and “negligently doing acts likely to spread infectious diseases” as stated by the Uganda Police Force on their official Twitter page. Whiles in detention, Omah Lay and Tems were charged to court and a video of them arriving at the court in handcuffs has sparked outrage as Omah Lay lamented they are being treated like murderers Reacting to this, Nigerian artists took to their Twitter pages with the new trending hashtag #FreeOmahLay to communicated their message to the Government of Ugandan. #FreeTems #Freeomahlay ?
