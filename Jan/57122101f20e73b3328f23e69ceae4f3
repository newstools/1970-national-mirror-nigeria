 Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has urged the Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, Dr Isa Pantami to immediately resign from his post, after he was accused of having links with terror groups. According to the governor, an allegation that the United States of America has put a serving minister on its watch list because of terrorism, should be taken up with all seriousness and tactfulness. He spoke with the African Independent Television (AIT) in Port Harcourt, the Rivers State capital on Tuesday where he made the revelations known. He said: “if an American government says your minister is on a watch list, it calls for concern for you say look there is a problem. “The moment a high government official is on a watch list as to regards to terrorism, no government can fold its hands and allow it. I don’t understand why a reasonable government will allow such a person to be in the cabinet.” he added. In other news, Nyesom Wike appealed to the Federal Government to give states the power to develop and manage their respective minerals and in turn, pay royalties to the central government. He said: “The federal government is carrying so much load that they are not supposed to carry, allow states to develop these minerals and pay royalty to the federal government, that is the way it’s supposed to be,”
