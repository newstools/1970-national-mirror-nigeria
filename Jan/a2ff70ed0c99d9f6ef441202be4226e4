 Erstwhile Super Eagles gaffer Samson Yebowei Siasia has described Europe second wave Covid-19 outbreak, which has slowed down his quest to seek justice at CAS as a huge setback. Siaone was initially scheduled to hit Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS) for his appeal on October 6, 2020, in the wake of his lifetime ban by FIFA, but he was held back by Covid-19 outbreak which sent Europe into complete lockdown. But in an exclusive chat with FCNaija on Monday, the former, U-20 coach lamented that his third hearing billed for January 10, 2021, has again been postponed for the third time due to the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak as many European countries implemented lockdowns that greatly constrained all sorts of activity. ” I was supposed to travel for my appeal hearing on the 10th but how do one get to Europe now with virtually all activities suspended due to the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak ” This case was supposed to be opened last October but we all know how Covid-19 triggered global lockdown and my intention was to end this delay once for all early this year before the second wave outbreak began. “It’s been two odd years now and it’s not funny at all. I know I will get to the bottom of this and get justice. I shall keep Nigerians posted with the latest development,” Siaone lamented on Monday. The 52-years old coach was banned for life after he was found guilty of agreeing to accept a bribe to fix matches. He was also fined £42,000 for breaching FIFA code of ethics even though the world soccer governing body failed to specify when Siaone violation occurred. It remains to be seen how the former U-23 coach intends to steady his ship in the midst of the storm as he faces a race against time to return to active coaching after nearly over two years of redundancy.
