 An unconfirmed report being circulated on social media states that actress and YouTuber, Princess Shyngle has been rushed to the hospital following an attempt to end her life. The delectable screen diva was spotted in an ambulance in a video that has since been deleted as she was being rushed to a medical centre in the United States for treatment after she allegedly drank a substance believed to be poison. The actress revealed in her Instastories that she’s really depressed shortly before the incident. She shared the video along with this caption: “Depression is real. I gat this.” This is actually not the first time the curvaceous actress who recently divorced her husband after just three months of marriage has attempted to committed suicide. Her first time was in 2018 when she reportedly drunk bleach but fortunately for her, she was rescued by a neighbour and rushed to Vedic Lifecare Hospital in Lekki, Lagos State. The actress lighted up Instagram recently when she disclosed that she has divorced her husband just after three months of marriage. In what sounds like a flick out of a Nollywood script, the Gambian actress and her husband are no longer together after three months of marriage and the drama which has been sprinkled on its aftermath has set tongues wagging even the more. Princess accused her husband Bala Gaye of physically abusing her and even pulling a gun on her. Apparently, she was forced to come out after the husband went on Instagram live to tell the world that his wife locked him out of the house after a little disagreement about 8 weeks ago and he hasn’t seen her for 7 weeks. He added that she’s in New York doing “ her thing”.
