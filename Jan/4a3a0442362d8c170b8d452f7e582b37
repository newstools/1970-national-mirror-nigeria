 Donald Trump, Lil Wayne, and Kodak Black Donald Trump granted pardons to rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black on Tuesday night as part of a last-minute spree that saw Trump issue clemency to many political allies on his final full day in office. Wayne, whose real name is Dwayne Carter, pleaded guilty on a federal weapons charge last year and received a full pardon. Kodak Black, whose real name is Bill Kapri, received a commutation after being charged in 2019 with falsifying information on federal forms to buy firearms. Other names on the presidential pardon and commutation list include Steve Bannon, former Detroit Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick, and Death Row Records co-founder Michael “Harry-O” Harris.
