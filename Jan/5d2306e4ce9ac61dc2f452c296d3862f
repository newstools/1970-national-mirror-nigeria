 Fikayo Tomori is set to make his first start for AC Milan against Bologna on Saturday, according to reports. The England international joined the Rossoneri’s on loan for the rest of the season with an option for a permanent deal. Tomori enjoyed a decent debut in the Milan derby and he is tipped to replace Simon Kjaer who is struggling with a muscle injury. The on loan Chelsea defender revealed that the players at AC Milan believe the club can win the Scudetto. “I arrived with Milan first in the table,” he said at a press conference. “We have to believe in the Scudetto. “It would be a great result. We shouldn’t be afraid to talk about the Scudetto, we all believe in it.” About his impressed debut against Inter in the Derby della Madonnina, he said: “Even in the Premier League, matches are played with great aggression. Derbies are very intense matches. “I’m very happy to be here. We are in a positive moment, I want to contribute. I will give everything on the pitch, with great desire and determination. “There are differences on a technical-tactical level. The English game is more aggressive and physical, but here I have to pay more attention to tactics. “However, I’m also here to improve, I’m ready to listen to all the advice that [Paolo] Maldini, the coach and my teammates will give me.” Post Views:
