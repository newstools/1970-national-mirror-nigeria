A bold claim for Antonio Conte’s men to come out victorious in Sunday’s tie attracts a mouthwatering 2.50 odds but one may be wary of going for a straight win for Inter as they have not achieved this feat since September 2016. In fact, in those seven games played in this period, Inter have endured a run of five defeats and two draws.  So if you are pledging your alliance to Juve for a straight win, Betpay is offering 2.75 odds while staking for a draw affords you a massive 3.80 odds Inter and Juventus were far from convincing in their midweek domestic cup action with both Italian Cup last-16 games going into extra-time on Wednesday. That nonetheless, a different ball game is expected on Sunday especially as these two teams are still chasing table toppers, AC Milan.  It would also be nice to see how the league top scorers will fare against themselves. Ronaldo has 15 goals, with Inter’s Lukaku trailing close at 12. Staking for both teams to score is at 1.60 odds on Betpay while over 2.5 goals attract 1.75 odds Inter’s focus is now on domestic trophies and for them to stand a chance, they would have to halt the dominance of the Old Lady over them. Since September 2016, Inter has not beaten Juventus – with a run of five defeats and two draws. Will that end this Sunday? Prediction Inter 2-2 Juventus Post Views:
