 Nigerian filmmaker Kunle Afolayan has signed a deal with Netflix to make three new films set in his home country. The streamer has showcased his previous films including The CEO, October 1, The Figurine and most recently Citation, and will now commission three new movies from the filmmaker: a historical drama, a folklore fantasy and a character drama. All three of the pics will be set in Nigeria. The first will be an adaptation of Nigerian-American novelist Sefi Atta’s third novel, Swallow, about a naive secretary whom, after a series of career woes, considers her roommate’s offer to work as a drug mule in mid-1980s Lagos. The movies will also debut exclusively on Netflix globally.
