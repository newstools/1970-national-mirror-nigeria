 Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman has drawn up a possible transfer list for the winter transfer market after assessing the weakness of the team. Koeman is set to bring in Dutch sensational Memphis Depay and Manchester City defender Eric Garcia as they remain the Catalan main target in the last summer. The manager addresses the transfer issue during his press conference ahead of the clash against Athletic Bilbao. “The team tries to play in the same way whether we are at home or away,” Koeman added.”We want to create danger and have opportunities to score, but away from home, we haven’t had the effectiveness that a team like Barcelona should have.

Koeman has been impressed by the American defender but reaffirms his belief that there will be ups and downs along the way with a talent of such a tender age. “Dest has ups and downs during matches, he started very well for us but he is 19 years old and needs time to adapt,” Koeman confirmed. “Like any footballer, he has the right to make mistakes and then improve from them. I’m not disappointed in him because he is young and these things are normal.” Post Views:
