 Serie A side AC Milan are interested in the services of Reading starlet Michael Olise, according to reports. The French professional footballer of Nigerian descent is currently monitored by a host of Premier League sides ahead of next month’s transfer window. The 19-year-old has been in sensational form this season and he is about to enter the final 18 months of his contract at the Royals and is yet to extend his current deal. Italian news outlet seriebnews.com claims that Stefano Pioli’s side are keeping tabs on Olise ahead of a potential bid in January. The report says if Milan were to lure him to the San Siro it would be a ‘long-term operation,’ as he would then be loaned out to another Italian club, either low in Serie A or competing at the top of Serie B. Clubs like Monza, Spal, Lecce and Chievo are some of the clubs mentioned as potential loan destinations for Olise. Olise has scored four goals and contributed eight assists in 21 games for Reading so far this season.
