 Manchester United have completed the signing of wunderkind Amad Diallo from Serie A giants Atalanta for £37m. The 18-year-old Ivorian winger has signed a contract to the end of June 2025, with the option of an extra year. Both clubs first announced on 5 October 2020 – deadline day at the end of the summer transfer window that the deal was done but subject to a medical, work-permit and personal terms. Speaking to the club’s oficial website, Man United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: “As a club, we have followed Amad for a number of years and having watched him myself, I believe he is one of the most exciting young prospects in the game. “Manchester United has such a proud history of developing young players and everything is in place to enable Amad to reach his potential here. “It will take time for him to adapt but his speed, vision and fantastic dribbling ability will stand him in good stead to make the transition. He is a player with all of the raw attributes that are needed to be an important player for Manchester United in the years to come.” Diallo, who predominantly plays as a right winger, added: “After waiting since the summer, it is finally a dream come true to complete my move to Manchester United. I am hugely ambitious and there is so much that I want to achieve in the game; when I spoke to the manager I knew that I had joined the perfect club. “This is a really exciting squad with so many great players, I can promise that I will work hard every day to learn from them and give everything to develop my game. The coaches have been fantastic since I signed, we have been in touch regularly and they have already given me a lot of great advice. “I have had time to prepare for this move, both physically and mentally, and I have worked really hard to be ready to make the step up to this amazing club.” Post Views:
