 Karim Benzema turns it around after scoring twice in Real Madrid 2-1 comeback win over Elche in the La Liga encounter on Saturday evening. Los Blancos who started the day eight points behind their city rivals Atletico Madrid, were stunned in the 61st minute when Dani Calvo thumped home a header. Benzema equalised from Luka Modric’s cross in the 73rd minute but the  Frenchman produced a glorious angled strike following a one-two with Casemiro to seal the three-point to close the gap on the La Liga leaders Atletico Madrid. Real Madrid move into the second spot, a point above Barcelona who face Huesca on Monday. Atletico play Getafe later this night. Post Views:
