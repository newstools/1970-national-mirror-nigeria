 One of the abducted students of Greenfield University, Kaduna, has been released. Lauretta Attahiru, mother of the released student, confirmed the development to journalists on Tuesday. She, however, did not give details of how her son was released as she declined to speak extensively on the development. The police could not be reached to confirm the release of the student as Mohammad Jalige, spokesman of the Kaduna state police command, did not respond to telephone calls and a text message. The abductors of the students had earlier threatened to kill the victims if their demands are not met. The gunmen, suspected to be bandits, attacked the institution on April 18 and abducted some students. The state is yet to confirm the exact number of students taken hostage. The kidnappers subsequentlyÂ killed three of the students, and later another two, while negotiating an N800 million ransom with the parents.
