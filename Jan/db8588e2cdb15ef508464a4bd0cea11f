 Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has likened Kai Havertz and Timo Werner to the Blues legendary striker Didier in a bid to defend the Germans from their recent struggles in the Premier League. Werner has scored just four goals for Chelsea while his compatriot Havertz has scored only one goal and assist. Lampard has sprung to the defence of his summer signings once again, claiming anyone expecting them to perform to their best straight away ‘aren’t living in the real world’.
