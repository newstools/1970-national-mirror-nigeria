I have had many friends who played in Djurgården and always had a good view of Bosse Andersson who has known me since I was little. “So it has felt like I have a connection to Djurgården and it has been with me that I will someday play here. “I said that if I was to move back to Sweden, Djurgården is the association that is closest to my heart, so it became an obvious choice.” He continued: “I want to be able to feel at home and play in a team that wants to build me up and where I for my part can be involved and build up the team. “I did not get the playing time I was hoping for in Genoa and it has of course been hard. “But I still have high ambitions with my football, so for me this was a very good plan to get home to Sweden and Djurgården to start again.” Asoro started his career with FK Haninge before a spell at IF Brommapojkarna, Sunderland, Swansea City, FC Groningen Genoa (loan).
