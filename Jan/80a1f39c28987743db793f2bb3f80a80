 Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner has announced she has filed the paperwork to run for California governor. The former Olympic athlete and reality TV star will run as a Republican in the Democratic stronghold state. A recall election in the state could be confirmed this month after a petition against current governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, reached the number required to trigger a vote. Voters would be asked if they want Mr Newsom to stay or another candidate. According to the Axios news site, Ms Jenner has put together a team that includes some of former President Donald Trump’s advisers. “Californians want better and deserve better from the governor,” a statement from Ms Jenner said, confirming the news on her Twitter account on Friday. “For too long, career politicians have over-promised and under-delivered. We need a leader with the vision and resolve to see it through,” she added. Ms Jenner promised that her campaign will be one of “solutions” and provide a “roadmap back to prosperity to turn this state around”. She added that she will formally launch her campaign at a later date.
