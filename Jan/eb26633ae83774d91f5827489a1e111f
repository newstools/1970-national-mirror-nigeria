 President Muhammadu Buhari President Muhammadu Buhari has urged Nigerians not to allow “mischief mongers” to divide the country. The president in his Easter message to Christians, on Thursday, said Nigeria is “stronger and better” as one. “We should not allow the antics of a few mischief mongers to fragment the unity and faith that the vast majority of citizens of this country cherish and believe in,” Femi Adesina, presidential spokesperson, quoted him as saying. “As I’ve said before, we are better and stronger as one nation under God.” Buhari commended frontline health workers in the fight against COVID-19 for their sacrifices and efforts, while also applauding Nigerians for adherence to COVID-19 protocols. “President Buhari deeply acknowledges and appreciates the sacrifices of our doctors, nurses, and other frontline health workers who have made the difference in saving lives and ensuring the reduction of the spread of the virus,” he said. “I thank Nigerians who have religiously adhered to various interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19, including regular hand washing; safe distancing, wearing of face masks, and embrace of vaccination.” The president urged Christians to use the Easter celebration to renew hope and faith and show love and appreciation to one another. “As a government, we will continue to ensure that the weak, the poor, and the underprivileged in our midst are not abandoned,” Buhari said. “We have reached out with palliative care even in the midst of dwindling resources; we have tried our best to provide support to families and businesses affected at this time. “That is the spirit of Easter. The spirit of Faith. The spirit of Belief. The spirit of Hope. “I am convinced that the new resolve within the security personnel to make sure that insecurity in the country becomes part of our history will come to pass.”
