He and his wife were always at the forefront to protest against oppressive government policies. “As the spokesperson of the Afenifere, he discharged his duties diligently and defended the cause of the southwest passionately. He never hid his passion for the Yoruba people and was never timid to speak against any policy that would affect the generality of the nation. “Though, the activist has gone to the join his Maker, his humane and altruistic activities while on Earth will remain indelible in our hearts. “I commiserate with his immediate family, especially his wife and ‘Siamese twin’, Joe Okei-Odumakin, the Afenifere and indeed, the Southwest. I pray that his soul finds comfort in the bosom of the Almighty God. We shall all miss Odumakin. Goodnight, Yinka!”, the statement concluded. Vanguard News Nigeria
