Nigerians have taken to social to drag former Lagos state governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, over a birthday message on a billboard at Lekki toll gate the scene of the October 20 ‘Lekki Massacre’ On Monday, the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Tinubu, was celebrated by party members and other Nigerians as he turned 69. He had earlier arrived in Kano State to celebrate his birthday in the state. However, a billboard at the Lekki toll gate displayed birthday wishes for the elder-statesman who donated the sum of N50 million to victims of a recent fire outbreak at Katsina Central Market in Katsina State while neglecting victims of fire outbreaks in Lagos or other southern states. This is disrespectful to #Lekkitollgate victims. 10:20:20? https://t.co/wTnWNMgeBJ — iamOloriire ™?
