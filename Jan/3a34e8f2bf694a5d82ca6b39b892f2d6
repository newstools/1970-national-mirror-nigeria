Recall that Olorisupergal reported in September 2020 when Ms Comfort was taken into custody by the Nigeria Police and was detained at the First Criminal Investigation Bureau, Alagbon, Lagos. She was arrested for alleged theft of N30m invested in her business by some of her micro investors. Ms Comfort who was first arraigned in Igboshere Magistrate Court in 2020 faced three count charges for allegedly obtaining money by false pretence and stealing. She was later re-arraigned in court on December 24th 2020 and pleaded not guilty.
