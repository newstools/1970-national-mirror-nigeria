 Lil Uzi Vert Rapper Lil Uzi Vert has reportedly implanted a $24 million natural pink diamond in his forehead positioned between his eyes. He purchased the $24 million diamond from jewelry designer Elliot Eliantte, and spent the past four years paying for it. “I’ve been paying for a natural pink diamond from Elliot for years now,” he tweeted. “This one Stone cost so much I’ve been paying for it since 2017. That was the first time I saw a real natural pink diamond. A lot of M’s in my face.” According to Uzi, the diamond cost more than his home and all his cars combined including his Bugatti. “Yes my Bugatti can’t even pay for it … all my cars together ,plus home,” he wrote.
