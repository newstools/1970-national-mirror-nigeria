 Leicester City manager, Brendan Rodgers has hinted Kelechi Iheanacho may start ahead of Jamie Vardy against Wolves at Molineux on Sunday. The 24-year-old opened the scoring for Foxes with his first Premier League goal of the season when they beat Fulham 2-0 at Craven Cottage on Wednesday. However, following the return to full fitness of striker Vardy, Leicester manager Rodgers was asked if he would start the former England international and he replied: “The beauty of it is we don’t have to. That’s the key. Kelechi, the other night, he was terrific in his work. “He scored a great goal and he will be high in confidence. We all know Jamie is so important to us, but the beauty of it is, coming out of an operation, we don’t need to rush him.  “Just to have him available, whether to start or from the bench, it’s a huge boost for us. It’s not a problem. Its great Kels has got his goal because he’s worked so hard. “That’s not just in games he’s played, but every day in training, so he got his reward for that.” Post Views:
