 Fenerbahce new signing Mesut Ozil has revealed his admiration for Super Eagles legend Austin Jay-Jay Okocha. The former Arsenal player moved to Turkey on a three-and-a-half-year deal this month and recalls that the Nigerian was his favourite during his spell with the club but currently likes Dimitrios Pelkas in Erol Bulut’s team. “First of all, I greet everyone. I don’t know what to say. I’m very excited,” Ozil said. “Fenerbahce was a dream for me. I hope I will be useful to my team. I am very happy to be here. Thank you very much, everyone. “Among the players who played in Fenerbahce in the past, I liked Jay-Jay Okocha the most. Now I like Dimitrios Pelkas, with whom we played in the same position. He is a very talented player. I believe that we will be champions. Fenerbahce always plays for the title. There is always pressure on a football player. I always played in big clubs, and there was always pressure. “Fenerbahce is also a big club and I know there will be pressure here. This is a club I love very much. I will do my best. I hope everything will be fine. I can’t give a date about when to play but I want to play as soon as possible.” Okocha joined the Yellow Canaries from German club Eintracht Frankfurt in 1996, scoring 30 goals in 62 Super Lig appearances as he helped them win the Prime Minister’s Cup and Ataturk Cup during his two-year stint at Fenerbahce.
