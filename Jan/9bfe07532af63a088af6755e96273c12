 Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets were forced to a 1-1 draw by their Ghanian counterparts in their final group game at the ongoing West African Football Union (WAFU) B Tournament in Lome, Togo on Saturday. The Eaglets risk being eliminated from the WAFU tournament with Saturday’s disappointing result. With Group B having only three teams and each team to play only two matches, Coach Fatai Amoo’s boys are technically out having lost their first game by a lone goal to Cote d’ Ivoire. After a pulsating first half that failed to produce any goals, the Eaglets got a breaktrough when they were awarded a penalty kick in the 75th minute and was converted by Joseph Arumala. Unfortunately,  Nigeria’s lead lasted barely for seven minutes as the Ghana U-17 team were also awarded their own penalty and they promptly converted to make it 1-1. As it stands now, for Nigeria to progress to the last four, the Ivorians must beat the Black Satellites by at least two unreplied goals to stay in contention. Few weeks back, Nigeria’s U-20 team, the Flying Eagles were also in this similar precarious situation and they ended up being bundled out early in the WAFU tournament. Post Views:
