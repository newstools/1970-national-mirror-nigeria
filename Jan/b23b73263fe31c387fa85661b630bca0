 Sunday Igboho Sunday Adeyemo, youth leader better known as Sunday Igboho, has declared that the Yoruba are no longer part of Nigeria. Igboho made the declaration while speaking in Ibadan on Wednesday. In a video of the event that has gone viral, Igboho said all the borders will be opened, while lamenting that major institutions in the south-west are headed by people of Fulani origin. There is no evidence to substantiate this clam.
The youth leader came to prominence after he issued an eviction notice to herders in Ibarapa area of Oyo state. He also forced Seriki Saliu Abdulkadri, Fulani leader in Igangan, to leave the town and relocate to the north. “We no longer have peace in our home. We have a good country but our leaders are bad. We don’t want them again,” he said. “After this discussion, we will hold meeting and open our borders so that rice, food and other things can enter easily. Enough is enough. All our borders that Nigerian government closed, we are telling them we are no longer under them, we will go and open the borders. “We are ready for everything they want to do to us. I am speaking on behalf of Yoruba people.” The youth leader said the Yoruba are now united and with traditional rulers backing them. He also dared any traditional ruler that is against his own people to declare it publicly. “Some people can say that Yorubas are not united, we are united. If you want to know how united we are, touch one of us, you will know that all Yoruba kings are behind us,” he added. Igboho also asked the Yoruba in the north to return home and end their ”suffering”.
