 You must have heard of the rule that says “Do to others what you want them to do to you”, that is the Golden Rule. This rule basically tells you to treat others how you want to be treated. It is a maxim that is found in a lot of religions and cultures. It is important to empathize with other people, especially those who may be very different from us in certain ways. Before performing an action or doing something that will affect others, think about whether you would want others to do the same thing to you if you were in that position. It is easy to assume that you will never be in a position because of what your present status is, but trust me, things have a way of turning around and hitting you hard. Like they say, tomorrow is uncertain. There is the innate desire to be selfish, no doubt, it is important to think of yourself as you cannot love anyone more than you would love yourself, but the trick is, whatever you do to people, you do to yourself. So if you hurt people, you are hurting yourself, if you make people happy, you are doing same for yourself. The only difference is time. According to Marc H. Bornstein, and William E. Paden, the Golden Rule is arguably the most essential basis for the modern concept of human rights, in which each individual has a right to just treatment, and a reciprocal responsibility to ensure justice for others. The Golden Rule underlies acts of kindness, caring, and altruism that go above and beyond “business as usual” or “usual care”. Practice the golden rule today!
