 Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen is in the final stages of his recovery from injury and expected back in Naples from Belgium on Wednesday ahead of Serie A resumption, according to reports. The 21-year-old has not played any minute of football since he injured his shoulder while representing Nigeria in November and has since missed seven Serie A games and four Europa League matches for Napoli. Football-italia reports that the Nigerian forward could make his return against Cagliari on January 3 after the winter break. The Nigerian has trained in Belgium without pains and looks ready ahead of his return to action. Osimhen will also have the opportunity of facing five-time Ballon Do’r winner Cristiano Ronaldo when Napoli face Juventus in the Italian Supercup final on January 20. Their first meeting in October never happened and Juventus were awarded three points after Napoli failed to show up for the encounter. Interestingly, Napoli won their appeal against the decision to hand them a 3-0 defeat against the Old Lady and one point deduction for failing to play their Serie A match at Turin in October amid confusion over COVID-19 rules. Osimhen’s last game for Napoli before the shoulder injury was on November 8 against Bologna and he netted the winner during a 1-0 victory at the Renato Dall’Ara.
