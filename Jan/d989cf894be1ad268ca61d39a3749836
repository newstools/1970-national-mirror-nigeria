 Zinedine Zidane names Nigeria-eligible Marvin Olawale Akinlabi in the 21-man squad for Real Madrid clash with Liverpool onÂ Wednesday night UEFA Champions League encounter at Anfield. Zidane has named a 21-man squad for the second leg of the quarter-final clash against Liverpool after Los Blancos hold a 3-1 lead from last weekâ€™s first leg in Alfredo Di Stefano Stadium.  The French coach announces the list for the return match encounter with Jurgen Kloppâ€™ men via the Real Madrid official Twitter handle without club captain Sergio Ramos also sits out through injury. ðŸ“‹âœ… Our 21-man squad for the match ðŸ†š @LFC! #UCL pic.twitter.com/oJxBQQ9umx â€” Real Madrid C.F. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ (@realmadriden) April 12, 2021 Hazard fails to recover in time to make the squad as he once again must watch on from the sidelines after suffering from a muscle injury in the clash in La Liga against Elche earlier in March. The Spanish right-back Dani Carvajal unavailable, while Raphael Varane has Covid-19 and Lucas Vazquez is also out for the season and leaves a void at right-back which is likely to be filled by Alvaro Odriozola. Real Madrid will only have six La Liga matches left by the time he is able to get back on the pitch, but may also be through to the Champions League semi-finals, and much could yet depend on how much of an impact he makes as the team chase down a domestic and European double.
