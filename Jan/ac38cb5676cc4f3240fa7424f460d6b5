 Genk striker Cyriel Dessers has revealed that Super Eagles could set a record by reaching the quarterfinal of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The 26-year-old star made his debut for Nigeria in a friendly 1-1 tie with Tunisia on October 13, and that was his only appearance so far.  The three-time Africa champions have failed to go beyond the last eight of the FIFA World Cup on three previous occasions after losing to European nations of Italy, Denmark, and France in 1994, 1998, and 2014 respectively. Dessers expects to help Genort Rohr led Super Eagles to play a significant role in matching Cameroon and Ghana’s record in the FIFA World Cup by reaching the last eight of the tournament in Qatar and beyond.  Former Belgium U21 told Voetbal Zone: “Hopefully we can provide a stunt in the coming years. “A quarter-final at a World Cup should certainly be possible. There are more and more boys who receive European education, we can certainly play a significant role with that. Nowadays, a Nigerian attacker plays well in every top European competition. “Dessers refers to Victor Osimhen (Napoli), Alex Iwobi (Everton) and Samuel Chukwueze (Villarreal). “But also the talents that are coming. They can really make a difference in the coming years. Dessers has scored four goals in 13 appearances for Genk this season so far. Post Views:
