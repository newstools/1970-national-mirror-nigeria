There are days when you are rummaging through your closet and feeling totally uninspired not knowing what to wear. Cue in media IT girl – Tamara Adeyeba whose sense of style is chic, easy and stylish. Her style is defined by a few vital principles: a chic dress, a structured suit, and a bold selection of colours. Join us as we gather major sartorial inspiration for the week from Tamara Adeyeba. Kick-off the week in a stylish black top and red pants. Switch things up with a chic midi dress to win all the accolades. Because on Wednesdays, we wear pink! A look that takes you from work to an evening hangout. It’s the end of the week, step out in a stylish denim look. Saturday picnics call for a chic flared dress. Date night calls for high fashion.
