 Why Super Eagles or any other African country won’t win FIFA World Cup anytime soon, according to German tactician Gernot Rohr. Brazil great Pele famously predicted that an African nation would win the world most glamorous tournament on the planet before the turn of the 21st century. However, 21 years after the three-time FIFA World Cup statement no Africa national team including Super Eagles since Egypt made their debut in 1934 to represent the continent. Rohr has now revealed the reasons why Africa’s continuous failure to lift the World Cup as told News Central TV. “We are not ready to win the world cup, for several reasons. “General organisation. Still a lot of problems for travelling, for preparation of the games specifically. Like here we will play in Lagos. Ten years no match of the Super Eagles, so we know that there’s no tradition here. The former Bordeaux manager also said the lack of African players at top clubs in Europe means it would be difficult for the countries to win the biggest sporting prize on earth. “France is the champions at the moment, where they are playing? They are playing in PSG, Bayern Munich. Four of them are world champions at their clubs also. “So when you have so many of your players from your countries playing in the best clubs, so the probability that you also have one of the best teams in the world is very big. “So what we have in Nigeria for example, we have our players in Fulham, in West Bromwich. It’s not Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Manchester United or Barcelona. But the other ones they have their players there. “So it would be a miracle if we actually win the world cup, Rohr concluded.
