 Chikwe Ihekweazu The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) says travellers found to be in possession of fake coronavirus test results will be arrested and prosecuted. Speaking during the media briefing of the presidential task force (PTF) on COVID-19 on Monday, Chikwe Ihekweazu, NCDC director-general, announced that a verification platform has been launched to confirm results. Ihekweazu maintained that travellers who present fake COVID-19 results at airports will be prosecuted, adding that tests conducted by private laboratories for travel purposes will now be verified by airlines, embassies and countries. “Many of you would have heard my previous comments around the verification platform for test results for travellers. That verification platform is now live,” he said. “Last week, many returning travellers were turned back and handed over to security agencies because they were trying to travel with fake lab results. “Sometimes, these results were procured by agents. But to be honest, everyone has to take responsibility for the test results in your hand. “From now on, all tests by private lab for travel purposes will be verified by airlines, by embassies, by countries. “We advise all Nigerians; everyone travelling should spare themselves the inconvenience and embarrassment by doing the test in one of the accredited labs, which you can find on our website. “Before you travel, please check the destination country’s requirements if it includes negative PCR test. Do this in any of the accredited labs, and you will get the result that is verifiable through any of the airlines. It’s very important to do this.”
