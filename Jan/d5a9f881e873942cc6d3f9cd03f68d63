 Son Heung-min scored his 100th goal for Tottenham Hotspurs as Jose Mourinho’s side returned to winning ways after a 3-0 victory over Leeds United in the Premier League encounter on Saturday afternoon. Goalkeeper Illan Meslier’s misplaced pass led to Harry Kane opening the scoring with a penalty after Ezgjan Alioski fouled Steven Bergwijn. Kane then turned provider, with a curling cross from the right that was swept in by Son at the near post as the hosts doubled their advantage. While Leeds streamed forward at every opportunity and carved out chances of their own, they often left themselves exposed in defence and were fortunate not to be more severely punished by Mourinho’s side. As it was, Toby Alderweireld’s near-post header rounded off the scoring at the start of the second half, with Meslier again culpable as he fumbled the ball over the line. Spurs’ first league victory since 6 December lifts them to third in the table, with Leeds remaining 11th.
