AI-powered social media experience, Triller, and next-generation music entertainment company SoundCloud, have today announced a new integration. This integration will uniquely showcase and support emerging independent artists with the launch of a dedicated SoundCloud-curated playlist featured on Triller.  For SoundCloud artists, access to the Triller platform will provide more marketing tools to help independent artists grow their careers. The SoundCloud playlist is located on the Triller app’s Music Discovery page, establishing a unique home on Triller for identifying new, up-and-coming artists bubbling up on SoundCloud today.
Updated monthly with fresh, standout tracks hand-selected by music teams at Repost by SoundCloud, SoundCloud’s creator services division, all tracks are available for Triller creators for use in their own video content within the app.  Other features of the new integration are as follows: As an AI-driven social platform that delivers a suite of technologies for artists, creators, and users, to fully control the creation of short-form video and music editing possibilities, Triller saw untapped potential in the idea of providing independent artists on SoundCloud with a way to cross-promote their music via the Triller channel. “With a shared goal of showcasing established and emerging talent, this partnership puts artists first—just like Triller does—enabling them to develop a Triller fan base that is empowered to create, share and connect,” said Mahi de Silva, CEO of Triller. “The new SoundCloud playlist on Triller offers one more way to elevate and promote the rising artists who are building their careers independently today,” says Allison Moore, Head of Artist Marketing at Repost by SoundCloud. “We’re very excited to be working with Triller to connect these artists with a new audience—helping them to get discovered, build their profiles, and grow their careers both on and beyond SoundCloud.” The SoundCloud playlist launches on Triller and is available on SoundCloud, today.
