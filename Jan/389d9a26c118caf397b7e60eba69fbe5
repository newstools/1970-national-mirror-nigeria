 Drake ( Source: Instagram/@champagnepapi) The wait for Drakes Forthcoming album ‘Certified Lover Boy’ is going to continue longer than fans expected as the Canadian rapper just postponed the release with no specified date. Back in October, the rapper announced that the project would be out in January 2021. However, in an update posted on his Instagram story on Wednesday, Drake said that the album has been delayed due to a recent surgery. “I was planning to release my album this month but between surgery and rehab my energy has been dedicated to recovery,” Drake wrote on his story. “I’m blessed to be back on my feet feeling great and focused on the album, but CLB won’t be dropping in January.” However, Drake assured fans that the album will release this year, writing: “I’m looking forward to sharing it with you all in 2021.”
