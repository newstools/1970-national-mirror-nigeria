 Watford coach Xisco Munoz has sent message to Super Eagles duo William Troost-Ekong, Isaac Success and teammates ahead of third round Emirate FA Cup clash against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Saturday night. The Hornets where relegated from the Premier League at the end of last season but the London outfit keen on returning to the topflight as they sit sixth in the Sky Bet Championship standings following their 2-1 loss at Swansea last weekend. Now comes a tough FA Cup trip to Old Trafford, where the Spanish coach Xisco wants Super Eagles duo of Ekong, Success and their Watford teammates to do themselves and the fans proud ahead of the third round clash against Odion Ighalo’s Manchester United at Old Trafford.  “The most important thing is we go there and fight like animals and enjoy the situation,” Munoz said. “I know it will be difficult because Manchester United is a perfect team, but we need to give our best and try very hard, because the most important thing is that our fans enjoy watching our team. “We go there with maximum ambition, we will work very hard and it is important to see we are growing game by game. “This is our objective and it’s important we continue with the same attitude, work and spirit.” Post Views:
