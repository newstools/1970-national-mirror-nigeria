 Fani Kayode Femi Fani Kayode has reacted after Sunday Igboho, a Yoruba activist issued a quick notice to the Fulanis in Igangan, Ibarapa East local Government Area in Oyo state to vacate the area over alleged kidnapping and banditry. Femi Kayode took to his twitter page to warn the Buhari administration not to try to arrest or kill Sunday Igboho because of the dire consequences it would have on the government and Yoruba land. He advised the Government to exercise a great deal of patience in dealing with the matter. He wrote: “It would be dangerous, reckless and counter productive for Buhari to ARREST or KILL Sunday Igboho. When the Northern youths demanded that Igbos should leave the north no-one was arrested. Why should Sunday be arrested or killed for asking KILLER Fulani herdsmen to leave the southwest?. I advise the FG to tread softly because Sunday has the full support of the Yoruba nation because he has spoken for the people. Kill him & you make him a martyr for Oduduwa, arrest him & you make him the greatest hero of the Yoruba since independence. Whichever way he wins” It would be dangerous, reckless & counter productive for Buhari to ARREST or KILL Sunday Igboho. When the Northern youths demanded that Igbos should leave the north no-one was arrested. Why should Sunday be arrested or killed for asking KILLER Fulani herdsmen to leave SW? 1/4 — Femi Fani-Kayode (@realFFK) January 23, 2021
