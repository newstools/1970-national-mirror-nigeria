 Big task ahead as Enyimba hope to overturn a 3-0 deficit they suffered against Al Merreikh of Sudan in the first leg of the CAF Champions League encounter. The Peoples Elephant must defeat the 21-time Sudan Premier League winners by four goals without conceding to secure a place in the lucrative group phase of the tournament.  However, it is the second time Enyimba have faced such a deficit in the CAF Champions competition, and are hoping for a more successful outcome. Boys landed 🛬 safely in Abuja.
El Merreikh will take a domestic flight to Owerri then a bus to Aba.
A long and exhausting journey, but we still so excited to make it through with another WIN !
