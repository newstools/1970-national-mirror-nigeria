 President Muhammadu Buhari and United States of America’s President Joe Biden The president of Nigeria, President Muhammadu Buhari has asked the international community to help in fighting the insecurity situation in Nigeria. The president reportedly made this call during a virtual meeting with the US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken. During the meeting, President Buhari indicated to the United States (U.S) to relocate its Africa Command (AFRICOM) headquarters from Stuttgart in Germany to its theatre of operation to Africa. This was made known in a recent statement released by the spokesperson for the president, Femi Adesina. The statement reads; “The security challenges in Nigeria remain of great concern to us and impacted more negatively, by existing complex negative pressures in the Sahel, Central and West Africa, as well as the Lake Chad Region. Compounded as the situation remains, Nigeria and her security forces remain resolutely committed to containing them and addressing their root causes. The support of important and strategic partners like United States cannot be overstated as the consequences of insecurity will affect all nations hence the imperative for concerted cooperation and collaboration of all nations to overcome these challenges. In this connection, and considering the growing security challenges in West and Central Africa, Gulf of Guinea, Lake Chad region, and the Sahel, weighing heavily on Africa, it underscores the need for the United States to consider re-locating AFRICOM Headquarters from Stuttgart, Germany to Africa and near the Theatre of Operation.”
