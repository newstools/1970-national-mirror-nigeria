 Lobi Stars new signing Chukwuka Onuwa says he wants more playing time at the club and expressed disappointment over the goalless draw against Abia Warriors during the Match-Day 7 of the Nigeria Professional football league (NPFL) played at the weekend. The former Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM FC) midfielder who made his fourth appearance for the Ortom boys from the bench in the encounter couldn’t affect the game like he would like as the visitors gained a vital point at the Aper Aku Stadium. Speaking to SportingLife, he revealed: “I’m disappointed because we didn’t do well in the first half of the game. We know Abia Warriors are in the relegation zone but they are a good team. It was disappointing that we couldn’t take our chances but we need to work more and by the Grace of God we are going to get it right.” The diminutive midfielder has registered just one assist so far for Lobi Stars this season and has vowed to improve his goals tally if given more playing time at the club. He said: “I’ve played four games so far but I’m looking forward to more playing time in the team. I really need to work very hard. You can see when I was introduced in the last few minutes (against Abia Warriors) I tried to help the team by doing my best. “I’ve only one assist so far and haven’t scored yet. I’m very worried about it and I’ll keep on working very hard to start scoring goals and providing assists.” Lobi Stars are currently placed fifth on the NPFL log with 12points, three adrift league leaders Rivers United while Abia Warriors sit 19th with just three points.
