 President Muhammadu Buhari Adrressing Released Kankara School Boys In Katsina (Source: The Punch) President Muhammadu Buhari on Friday, December 18, 2020, said that the abduction of 344 students of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara in Katsina State, was to embarrass his administration. The President made this statement when he met with the rescued Kankara students and representatives of their parents at the Banquet Hall of Government House, Katsina. Buhari said it was no coincidence that the bandits kidnapped the young boys on the very day he visited his home town, Daura after 18 months. “I normally visit my home town because I swore by the holy Quran that I will safeguard the nation’s constitution, hence I must hand over power on May 29, 2023 to the next government. “So, if God spares my life, I’ll definitely come home. This informed my visits home.’’ The president thanked God for sparing the lives of all the rescued students, urging them to put behind their ordeals in the hands of the bandits. He also advised the students to take their studies seriously. He also commended security officials involved in the rescue operation. The president reminded those saddled with the responsibility of safeguarding lives and property of citizens to bear in mind that they would also be judged by God after their earthly sojourn. Buhari had since departed Katsina State after his week-long visit to Daura, his country home.
