 Garba Shehu Senior Special Assistant to President Buhari on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu has opined that no enemy is capable of bringing down the Buhari-led government down. According to him, the government is up and doing in attending to the needs of the country with the insecurity and anti-corruption. He made the submission when he was engaged in an interview on Channels TV ON Friday, March 26. In his words: “I want to assure Nigerians that the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari is addressing multiple challenges that are facing the country especially in dealing with security and yet we are still making progress in agriculture, economy, anti-corruption. It is sad for the country that opposition is exploiting some of these things. It is quite unfortunate and I want to assure that the president remains focused in preserving the security and unity of this country. We accept that dissent is allowed, this is a democracy and people have a right to tell truth to government but we must be careful in doing that. Nobody can bring down the government because this is a government elected democratically. Government in a democracy come through periodic elections and if we have a government in office as we have, sponsored by political parties to win the elections, it is telling you that that confidence of the public is still there. People with strong ambitions, wait till four years, in fact, in our case, two more years to go to election and President Buhari will not be a candidate in that election”
