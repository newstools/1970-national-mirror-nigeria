Blue and Brown Mbombo celebrated their 31st birthday with an intimate outdoor party in Johannesburg, South Africa. The socially distanced celebration was attended by a few family and friends and was gorgeously decorated by WellSeated,Â  a South African event planner with a specialisation in bespoke luxury experiences. The twin ex-models were dressed in blush looks by South African designer Scalo. Check out the looks and snapshots from the fun day below!
