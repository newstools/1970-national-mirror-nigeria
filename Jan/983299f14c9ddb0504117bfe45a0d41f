The Inspector-General of Police, Ag. IGP Usman Alkali Baba has assured citizens of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Plateau State and other contiguous States, of safety and security as they go about their lawful day-to-day activities. The IGP’s assurance is coming on the heels of the unintended, viral spread of an internal directive issued to the Commissioners of Police in Plateau State and FCT Commands to forestall any likelihood of an attack or breach of security by organized criminal elements in their Areas of Responsibilities (AOR). Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba in a statement said, “The IGP’s directive, which is a deliberate, intelligence-driven and proactive measure, is designed to prepare the law enforcement community for comprehensive response to any threat to lives and property. “The IGP noted that the security alert, rather than becoming a source of panic to the citizens, should instead send a message of reassurance to them about the intellectual depth, capacity and operational preparedness of the Nigeria Police to pre-emptively deal and contain any threat to public peace and security. “The alert does not in any way suggest that an attack is imminent in any of the two States. “The Police High Command, therefore, calls for calm, urging citizens to go about their normal activities with a renewed sense of vigour, patriotism and vigilance as the Police continue to work with other relevant stakeholders to keep our public space safe.” Vanguard News Nigeria
