 Although fans and neutrals alike suffered through a drab Manchester derby over the weekend, that 0-0 draw extended Manchester City’s run of clean sheets to six straight competitive games, a new all-time club record. Despite their solidity, City have recorded their worst 11-game Premier League (PL) start in the last decade, albeit level with 2013/14 when they eventually won their second title. At home, the ‘Cityzens’ like to get their business done early – eight of their 11 scored home league goals came before HT and as such each home victory so far came after a won first half (HT: W3, D2). Moreover, there is yet to be a goalless first half here in the PL, and four of the five games saw over 1.5 first-half goals. Visiting West Bromwich Albion took another huge blow over the weekend, conceding the fastest PL goal of the season in just 20 seconds before going on to record a fifth defeat in six games (W1). Worryingly, WBA have an identical record to the infamous 2007/08 Derby County side (W1, D3, L8) at this stage – the worst PL side of all time! WBA have amongst the worst away defensive records in the PL with 13 conceded away goals so far (2.17 per-match on average). Moreover, WBA conceded first in five of six away league games and lost a league-high four away league games at both HT/FT (HT: D1, L5), scoring just once before the interval. Odds City are priced at 1.09 odds on Betpay to win and 10.55 for a draw, while a West Brom win is priced at a massive 25.05. Betting Tips Our tipsters consider this a no-brainer and have called it for City and you can stake on it on Betpay with odds of 1.09. Prediction Manchester City 3-0 West Brom
