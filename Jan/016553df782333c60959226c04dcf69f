 Italian legend Gianluigi Buffon has revealed that he regrets his mistake against Manchester United two seasons ago. The Juventus goalkeeper says he still thinks about the moment three or four times a week. After Paris Saint German’s win at Old Trafford, Buffon’s mistake in the return-leg of the last 16 stage of Champions League cost the Ligue 1 giants qualification. “I think about it three or four times a week,” Buffon told L’Equipe. “I blame myself for an incredible mistake, a mistake that, with the experience I’ve made, I shouldn’t have made. Mentally, that night, I was not the same Gigi. For my concentration and for how I approached the game. “I didn’t have the strength or the energy to feel that we were preparing for the game too lightly. Maybe, I did it not to be the old man who always yells at everyone. I didn’t say: ‘Hey guys, we’re not there’. At Juventus it would not happen. I was sure that in that season we would have reached the final.” Buffon spent one season at PSG in the 2018-19 campaign before his return to Juventus.
