 Donald Trump Former US President Donald Trump on Tuesday launched a communications platform, which will eventually give him the ability to communicate directly with his followers, after months of being banned from sites like Twitter and Facebook. The platform, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump” appears on www.DonaldJTrump.com/desk. The space will allow Trump to post comments, images, videos and allows followers to share the former president’s posts to Twitter and Facebook; however, the new platform does not have a feature to allow users to “reply” or engage with Trump’s posts.
