 Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers has sympathised with Super Eagles forward Kelechi Iheanacho after his penalty miss denied the Foxes victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Kelechi who was without a goal this season had an opportunity of breaking his duck when the Foxes were awarded a first half penalty but the Nigerian causally missed from 12yards. However, Wilfred Zaha’s goal was canceled by a late Harvey Barnes goal to spare Iheanacho’s blushes. Rodgers said after the match: “I said at half time, it was one you (Iheanacho) have to let go of. He practised yesterday and hit five out of five, so he was confident, but it is just one of those things. Harvey was outstanding, to have played his second 90 minutes [in two days] having done so well against Manchester United as well. He won us the penalty in the first half and he is a threat. “We have had two tough games and you know Palace can be very good on their day. I still feel we dominated the game with the changes we made but I’m pleased we kept fighting at the end.”
