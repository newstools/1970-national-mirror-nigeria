 Still very much in title contention, Leicester City are protecting a five-match unbeaten run (W3, D2) in all competitions as they look to keep up the pressure on the Premier League (PL) front-runners. Four games therein saw them net 2+ goals, although they can take a while to get going, having not scored inside the first 30 minutes in six competitive matches. Despite failing to score in just one of their last 14 home league games played on a Saturday, Leicester have won just two of their previous seven PL home fixtures (W2, D1, L4). However, there’s been no shortage of attacking intent, as the ‘Foxes’ have earned an impressive average of 6.63 corners per home league game this term. Top-four chasing Southampton have had a lengthy break following their impressive 1-0 win over Liverpool (Jan 4). That was their third consecutive PL clean sheet (W1, D2), and a fifth game in a row to feature under 2.5 goals (W1, D3, L1). Interestingly, the Saints’ last three PL fixtures to produce over 0.5 goals have all featured one before the 20th minute. The ‘Saints’ have been happy travellers recently and are unbeaten in seven PL away games (W3, D4). Furthermore, the away side on the day is unbeaten in the last six PL H2Hs (W5, D1). Meanwhile, each of Southampton’s last three league H2Hs played vs Leicester anywhere have featured exactly one fewer goal in the second half than in the first.
