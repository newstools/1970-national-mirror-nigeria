 Governor of Rivers state, Nyesom Wike has cautioned herdsmen that they should be ready to bury Nigeria if something bad happens to Governor Ortom. Governor Ortom’s life was in danger yesterday as he was nearly killed by Fulani herdsmen. He reacted to the news that Fulani herdsmen attacked the convoy of Benue Governor Samuel Ortom at Tyo-mu along Makurdi – Gboko road. He threatened that there would be chaos in the country should something happen to him. In his words: “If you kill Ortom, then be prepared to bury Nigeria. If anything happens to Governor Ortom, the Federal Government will be held responsible and they should be prepared that there will be no more Nigeria.”
