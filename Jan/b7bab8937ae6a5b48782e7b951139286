 Nasir Elrufai Kaduna state Governor, Nasir el-Rufai has disengaged 19 political appointees in an effort to “rightsize” the state’s public service. A statement issued by the Kaduna government on Wednesday said this is the first phase of the rightsizing exercise at the executive level. The governor has been at loggerheads with the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) over the state’s government resolve to disengage 4,000 workers across the 23 LGAs in the state. The workers went on a warning strike but suspended the action after the federal government intervened, following a request for negotiations. The statement said a deputy chief of staff and two special advisers are among the 19 appointees disengaged by the governor.
