 An unknown gunman shot former Nigerian beauty queen and doctoral student in Philadelphia called Najeebat Sule while she was sitting in her car in front of her family’s home. After three weeks, the Police have not been able to gather any substantial information surrounding her death leaving her family searching for answers. According to reports, she recently earned a Master’s degree in public health from West Chester University and was crowned a second runner-up at the Miss Nigeria International pageant. The 24 year old was killed before 6pm on March 12, few meters away from her home in the 8800 block of Frankford Avenue. It was later gathered that Magaji was the last person to have seen Sule alive as the duo spent time together in Magaji’s house eating snacks and watching Netflix. Najeebat was shot several times in her grey Toyota Corolla while exchanging text messages with Magaji. According to Adewale Sule, the father of Najeebat, he saw the man shoot at his daughter and he chased him. “I saw the guy shooting my daughter. He shot the last round, and I pursued him. He ran back to his car,” said the father. Regrettably, doctors of the Jefferson Torresdale Hospital declared Najeet dead 30 minutes later after they rushed her to the health center. According to Fox29, Sule forms part of the 120 people who have died in a surge in gun violence in Philadelphia so far this year.
