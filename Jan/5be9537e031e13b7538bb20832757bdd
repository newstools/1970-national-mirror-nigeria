 Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored a brace as Arsenal beat Newcastle to climb into 10 places in the Premier League. Gabon international, who had earlier hit the post from a tight angle in the first half, opened the scoring in the 50th minute when he fired past Newcastle goalkeeper Karl Darlow. Arsenal doubled their lead as Emile Smith Rowe’s pullback found Bukayo Saka and the England international side-footed the ball into the net. Aubameyang got his second and the Gunners’ third after Cedric Soares, in his first league start of the season, got to the byline and set up the striker. Former African Player of the Year scored 29 goals in all competitions last season, including 22 in the Premier League, but he had previously struggled for goals in 2020-21. This double took his league total to five for the campaign and the victory takes Arsenal above Aston Villa into 10th, with the Gunners seven points adrift of fourth-placed Liverpool in the last Champions League qualifying spot. Newcastle are 15th, seven points clear of 18th-placed Fulham, although the London side have a game in hand. Post Views:
