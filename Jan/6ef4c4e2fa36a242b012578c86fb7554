 â€˜â€™I regret taking care of my skin.â€™â€™ â€“ says no one. The Nigerian beauty industry has been criticized for a long time due to the lack of authenticity of all-natural products. We have heard horror stories of skin-damaging due to the use of toxic products labeled as â€˜â€™organicâ€™â€™. The skin is like a sponge that absorbs everything you put on it, be it good or bad.  After 2years of extensive product research, we present to you Botanical Body by Organic Shoppe. Botanical Body is here to change this narrative. When it comes to holistic beauty, we go above and beyond, and this is because we believe that what goes on in your body is as important as what goes in.
