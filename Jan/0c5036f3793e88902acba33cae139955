A crowd gathered at about 11.00 am to observe the gory sight while a horde of flies fluttered around the decapitated bodies. “Some persons may have brought these corpses and dumped here in a vehicle last night”. Alex a commercial driver who parked to observe the spectacle observed. He said the people may have been killed in Calabar and taken to the  lonely area ” I wonder why police and security agents who mount roadblocks along this road could not intercept them because the odour that can emanate from such bodies can be very strong “ Ms Irene Ugbo the Cross River Police Command spokesman did not pick calls on her GSM line.
