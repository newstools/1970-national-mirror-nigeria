 This Mommy and Daughter duo is too cute! Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian‘s cute daughter, Olympia, has become a staple on Serena’s social media. The tennis star posted a series of cute pictures of herself and her daughter on Instagram, one of which showed Serena playfully holding a tennis racket with her daughter by her side as they both smiled at the camera, all glammed up in red carpet-worthy gowns.   She also posted a TikTok video of herself, Olympia, and a few friends dancing to Megan Thee Stallion‘s “Body“. In the video, Serena can be seen busting some moves in front of a wall in her beautiful tulle gown, before the camera pans out to see Olympia doing the same thing in a pink princess gown. This isn’t the first time Serena and Olympia have shared a tender mother-daughter moment with the world. In July 2020, the adorable were twinning on a tennis court in matching sportswear.
