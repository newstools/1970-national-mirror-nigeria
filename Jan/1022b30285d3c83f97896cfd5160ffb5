 Rangers International F.C’ creative midfielder, Chiamaka Madu is confident the Flying Antelopes will emerge victorious in their matchday 7 NPFL 2020/2021 fixture against Sunshine Stars F.C at the Akure township stadium this weekend. Madu told the club’ media that he and his teammates are going to Akure to annex all three points and would not settle for less. The encounter which will happen on Sunday, January 31, 2021, hope to see the ‘Flying Antelopes’ players come up against their former coach, Olugbenga Ogunbote, who is now directing affairs at the ‘Owena Waves’. Madu said on Thursday, January 28, 2021, that he and his teammates have internalized all that the coach and his technical team have told them and were in the best frame of mind to do what they are paid to do on the field of play in Akure.  “I think it’s going to be an interesting game due largely to the fact that we dropped two points in our last match while they got all three points in theirs away from home. We are looking forward to recover all the points we have lost,” stated the mercurial midfielder. On the fact that he and his team mates would be playing against their former coach, Olugbenga Ogunbote, Chiamaka said, “I think he is going to be the one that will panic the more because he knows what we are capable of doing and majority of the players that worked with him are still here and I know he is a very good coach and would prepare extra hard for this match. We are not going for a draw as we need all the three points at stake.”  Recall that in the only encounter between both sides last season in Akure, both teams cancelled each other out with the ‘Flying Antelopes’ missing a last-minute opportunity to grab all three points to the relief of the capacity filled stadium on February 23, 2020.
