 Out-of-form Arsenal take a trip to Liverpool to face Everton and our partner Betpay brings you the match preview and betting tips. Rejuvenated Everton have secured consecutive Premier League (PL) victories against top-five finishers from 2019/20, taking their five-game form to: W3, D1, L1. They scored six of their seven goals in that sequence before HT, and each of their previous two opening goals have arrived within the 20th-25th minute period. The Toffees’ record in their last PL home fixture before Christmas (1992-present) reads well: W12, D10, L6 (GF 34, GA 28), though they are winless in their last five such games (D2, L3). Both years ending in ‘0’ yielded draws, while eight of the ten draws in the whole sequence (including last season’s home clash vs Arsenal) ended 0-0. Arsenal have picked up just one win in their previous nine PL games (W1, D2, L6), So far, their attack has been a major issue, as evidenced by the fact that they haven’t scored more than a single PL goal in nine matches. Furthermore, their goal average of 0.85 is the fourth-lowest in the league, although their 110 PL goals versus Everton is more than they’ve scored against any other PL side, or any PL side has scored against another for that matter! The ‘Gunners’ have failed to score in three of their previous four PL matches on the road (W1, D1, L2), while both teams have scored in just one of their six PL away matches so far. Indiscipline is also an issue, as no team has picked up more PL red cards than Arsenal’s total of seven since Mikel Arteta took charge of the first team in Dec 2019. Odds Everton appear the favourites here and are priced on 2.55 odds while Arsenal are priced at 2.80. A draw attracts odds of 3.65.
