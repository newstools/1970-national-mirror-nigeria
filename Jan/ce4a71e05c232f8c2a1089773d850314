 It’s been a star-studded celebration for the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice-president Kamala Harris. Lady Gaga took the stage first, performing a powerful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” while Jennifer Lopez performed a medley of patriotic songs that included “This Land Is Your Land” and “America the Beautiful“. Take a look at the performances at the swearing-in ceremony: Lady Gaga My intention is to acknowledge our past, be healing for our present, and passionate for a future where we work together lovingly. I will sing to the hearts of all people who live on this land. Respectfully and kindly, Lady Gaga. ❤️🤍💙🇺🇸 — Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) January 20, 2021 Here's Lady Gaga's entire rendition of The Star Spangled Banner pic.twitter.com/O3b6Kkouoi — Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) January 20, 2021 Jennifer Lopez  Garth Brooks  Amanda Gorman Our National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman takes the #Inaugural59 podium. pic.twitter.com/CDVLhQ0C8W — #Inaugural59 (@JCCIC) January 20, 2021
