He captioned it: “I got you bro. I’m gone. Promise.” In the voice note, the man can be heard saying to Damson: “Look bro we need to talk. Stop posting s*** on social media. Like stop. Every time you post something, women go crazy, bro. “Like, I’ve been DMing this girl for three weeks straight, every time I think I’m making progress or I’m getting somewhere, you post something and then she ghosts me for four or five days bro. “Stop. PLEASE.” I got you bro. I’m gone. Promise.  pic.twitter.com/6ICofLz4om — Damson Idris (@DamsonIdris) May 6, 2021
