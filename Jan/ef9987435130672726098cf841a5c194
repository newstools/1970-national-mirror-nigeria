 Super Eagles vice-captain, William Troost-Ekong is targeting 90points for Championship side Watford as they chase automatic promotion to the Premier League. The Hornets are on a four-game winning streak and have lost just one of their last 10 to move level on points with second-place Brentford ahead of their game on Saturday against Bournemouth. “There is still a long way to go and we have to play Norwich and all the teams around us,” said the summer signing from Udinese. “I still think it’s difficult to say how many points we will need for automatic promotion. In the past it’s been between 75 and 90 points, so we want to reach that level before we start looking around at others. “We’ve got a board up and just crossing off the wins we think we need. I know it’s a cliche, but we are taking each game as it comes and the coach is hammering that into us. We aren’t looking at any calculations.” Post Views:
