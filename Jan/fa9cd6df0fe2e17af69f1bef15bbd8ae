 Francis Uzoho continued brilliant display as he helped APOEL Nicosia secure a 1-1 draw against AEK Larnaca in a Cypriot First Division encounter. The Week-19 match played at the Neo GSP Stadium on Wednesday saw the Super Eagles star make three good saves to deny the opponents an away victory. The visitors took the lead in the 58th minute through Ivan Trickovski but the home side rallied round immediately as Viktor Klonaridis leveled the scoreline two minutes later. The 22-year-old made three saves out of the four shots on goal by their opponent, during his 90 minutes of action to help his team move to the 10th spot on the log. Uzoho suffered ruptured ligaments and was carried off on a stretcher after the hour mark during the Super Eaglesâ€™ 1-1 international friendly draw with Brazil on October 13, 2019 at the National Stadium, Singapore.
