 Nigerian popular artist Peter Okoye from the defunct P-Square also known as Mr. P has disclosed that he is making more money as a solo artist. It’s no news that the twin brothers; Peter Okoye and Paul Okoye also known as Rudeboy Duo for many years. However, the brothers broke their bond and went their separate ways. The twin brothers, although separated musically, are doing well in their music industry. Both keep entertaining their fans and followers with their back-to-back hit songs. In a recent interview with Hip TV, Mr. P also known as Peter Okoye disclosed that he makes more money being a solo artist. He emphasized that he no longer spilt the money he gets from his music with anyone as he used to. He stated that he is now enjoying his freedom. In his words, he said “Hundred percent, I am. I don’t have to share three ways. Call it greed or selfishness. It’s your own cup of tea. I share with nobody. Yes, my management and my team. Fine. But I’m doing my own thing. I’m freer. I’m making more money. Freedom is key. I can get a call that there’s a show next week and it’s my daughter’s birthday. I can say, ‘cancel it’. As a group, I couldn’t do that. Moneywise, if I used to share three ways, I share alone. What am I doing music for? It’s about doing it how I feel it. It’s not even about the money. But when it comes to that, I make more than I was while in the group” he said.
