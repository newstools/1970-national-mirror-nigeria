 Edwin Okon, Coach of Rivers Angels Football Club of Port Harcourt, is confident of picking three points in Calabar when his side battle Pelican Stars on Match-day 7 of the Nigeria Women Football league (NWFL) Premiership on Wednesday. The NWFL reigning Champions who are still unbeaten this season wants to claim maximum victory over their hosts who are placed 12th on the league table with just one win from six matches. Coach Okon is however not taking anything away from Pelican whom he still believes could pose a problem for his side this midweek. “Pelican is a very good side, there are no pushovers in the Premier League today,” said the former Super Falcons coach. “But as a team, we are fully prepared because that’s why we are here. We pray for a good game tomorrow and equally promise not to disappoint the fans. As Champions that we are, we are going home with the three points.” On the Ten Million Naira pronouncement by the Executive Governor of Rivers State, Barrister Nyesom Ezenwo Wike (GSSRS, POS Africa) for every away victory, Okon said it was a big motivation for the team. “It’s a very big motivation for the team and the players know what is at stake,” he said. “These are the kind of things many teams need and I’m happy we got this. The entire team is ready to take up on the task and deliver,” Okon said. Post Views:
