 African music continues to gain global attention at an unprecedented rate with Nigeria being home to some of the most talented and entertaining artistes across various genres. In light of this, Audiomack has today announced a 3-day virtual concert series – “Hometown Heroes Nigeria”, to celebrate and showcase the best talents across the region. The concert series which will debut on the official Audiomack YouTube channel on May 25th – 27th will feature exclusive performances from several of Nigeria’s established and most promising artistes, including Omah Lay, Tems, Fireboy, Joeboy, Yemi Alade and more.
