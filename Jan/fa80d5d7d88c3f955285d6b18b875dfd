 The YouTube channel for the popular Nigerian cleric, Prophet T.B Joshua has been suspended. This comes after some videos he shared on the platform were considered inappropriate. In a recent report by the Premium Times, it was indicated that between 2016 and January 2020, the channel posted at least seven clips showing the charismatic Christian televangelist engaging in violent exorcism to ‘deliver gay and lesbian members of his church of their sexual orientation by casting out the demon of homosexuality. The decision to suspend the channel was carried out on April 12 and in giving reasons for the suspension, a YouTube spokesperson said; “YouTube’s Community Guidelines prohibit hate speech and we remove flagged videos and comments that violate these policies. In this case we have terminated the channel. YouTube prohibits content which alleges that someone is mentally ill, diseased, or inferior because of their membership in a protected group including sexual orientation.”
