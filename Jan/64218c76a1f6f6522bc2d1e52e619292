 Arsenal legend, Robert Pires believes Juventus midfielder Aaron Ramsey ‘will return’ to the North London club someday. The Frenchman thinks the former Gunner midfielder would ‘be perfect’ for the current system of new manager Mikel Arteta. “He’s doing well, so I’m satisfied. The competition at Juventus is terrible, because there are very strong players in every department,” Pires told TuttoJuve. “But every time he plays, he’s very consistent, has excellent technique and is often well positioned to score, as he did on Saturday against Sampdoria. He made an excellent choice. “I maintain that he is making a difference here too, because it’s not easy to play in such a quality midfield. I think he can help the team and be decisive like at Arsenal. “I know Andrea a little and I think he’s a young coach who is discovering how difficult the job is. And I expect him to count on Aaron, because he’s a great player and a very good professional. That’s a very important aspect for a coach.” Ramsey has played 20 competitive games in the 2020-21 season, but reports in Italy claims the Juventus are open to selling him in the summer. Post Views:
