In his words: “The program which will be delivered through the three platforms of CSDA, FADAMA, the Ministry of Commerce and State’s CARES Coordinating Unit with government interacting through members of the Steering Committee will ensure adequate supervision of the Delivery Platforms to deliver the services that are required,”. “Similarly, the Human Capital Development Council which came as a result of the resolution by the National Economic Council consists of 3 components of Health and Nutrition, Education and Labour force to achieve 24 million additional healthy, educated and productive Nigerians for a globally competitive nation by 2030” “This is aimed to provide equitable access to affordable and quality healthcare for every Nigerian, promote a quality, inclusive and functional education system and empower youth to have the capacity and skills to create or seek employment” The governor also explained that land certification initialization embraced by his administration is part of his government’s efforts to create a new, technology-driven economy for the 21st century. He said, “Land, being the most valuable resource, needs to be carefully guarded against abuse and misuse, noting that under the new system, all e-C of Os to be issued would be strictly based on the extant land use regulations,” “All problems associated with land transactions will be resolved with the use of modern technology as the recertification of all land titles will assist in the current fight against banditry and sundry crimes.” “Owners of all land titles would now have their records available in a secured database; and that the new e-C of Os would also make it easier for financial institutions to check the authenticity of certificates for those who choose to use them as collateral for bank loans.” he added.
