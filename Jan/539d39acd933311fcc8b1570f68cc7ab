 Nigerian striker Taiwo Awoniyi is enjoying a good run of form in the Bundesliga and that has seen him been labeled as a hero by his club Union Berlin. Only on Friday, Awoniyi scored his fourth goal of the season as Union Berlin secured a vital 2-1 win over Borussia Dortmund and that effort has seen the 23-year old Nigerian striker receiving rave reviews from his present employers. The club wrote: Hey, @taiwoawoniyi18 ! We are so proud of you tonight. Three amazing performances when we have injuries in that position. What a hero! From Imperial Academy to Union! https://twitter.com/fcunion_en/status/1340063584643112963 Fridayâ€™s result effectively ended a run of four straight games (three draws, one defeat) without a win for Union Berlin. They move up to the fifth position on 21 points in the Bundesliga table. For Awoniyi, his chances of getting a call-up to the Super Eagles is getting brighter by the day with this type of superlative performances week-after-week.
