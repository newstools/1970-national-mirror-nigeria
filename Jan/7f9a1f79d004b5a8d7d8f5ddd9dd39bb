Yearly, Muslims all over the world fast during Ramadan. Ramadan is a very important season in every Muslim’s life. It was during this holy month that the Quran was revealed for the first time as one of Islam’s five foundations. Today, OSG is sharing five songs that our Muslim audience can listen to this season to keep the faith. In no particular order, below are some songs to get grooving to this holy month. Maher Zain is an artist you should consider listening to this season. The multi-platinum artist is a Swede who rose to fame thanks to his distinctive voice and well-crafted R&B-influenced tracks. In 2009, I came across his song, “Awake.” I really can’t get tired of him after three albums and several songs. He is also quite famous on social media and has over 6 Billion views on YouTube and millions of fans on Twitter and Instagram. Check out his ‘Thank you Allah’ below.  Khaled Siddiq brings the people to connect with Allah with Rap. His ‘Say Mashallah’ is a great way to get to know this incredible young musician. As one of the most famous Muslim performers and YouTubers with more than 20 Million Views, he has also been devoted to charity works. His music is inspired by hip-hop, pop, and dancehall, and he is Jamaican, English, and Irish.  As a Pakistani-Canadian Muslim singer-songwriter with a smooth, calming tone to his accent, Irfa Makki has made waves with his songs.  Irfan was one of the special guests invited to play at Maher Zain Live in Concert at Melawati Stadium. Check out ‘I believe’ below.  If the rigors of Ramadan have worn you down halfway through the month, this is the ultimate tonic. The song acts as a timely reminder that Ramadan is about much more than fasting.  This is a perfect song to play in the last days of Ramadan to prepare for Eid. Eid Song is a family favorite from Sami Yusuf’s extensive discography, and it’s full of happy images of children waiting for and enjoying Eid.
