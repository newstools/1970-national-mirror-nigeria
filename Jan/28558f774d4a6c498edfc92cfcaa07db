 Chelsea is in talks to sign Bayern Munich attacker Robert Lewandowski, according to the report in the Sky Deutschland. The Polish attacker is considering his future at the Allianz Arena and a move to another club could be on the card. Chelsea is in need of a proven attacker as they struggle for goals this season with midfielder Jorginho their top scorer in the Premier League with seven, which have all come from the penalty spot. Lewandowski prefers a move to Spain to England, it is still possible to convince the attacker to join the Stamford Bridge outfit though the Premier League club will face a serious challenge from Barcelona who is interested in the services of the former Borussia Dortmund attacker. Barcelona is not in a favourable financial position at the moment and may allow the possibility of signing Lewandoski to pass by with Chelsea remaining the only serious contender for his signature. Paris Saint-Germain also fancy a move for the attacker, with manager Mauricio Pochettino keen on replacing Kylian Mbappe who wants out of the Ligue 1. Post Views:
