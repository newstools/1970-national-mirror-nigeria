 Former Manchester United striker Romelu Lukaku has declared himself one of the best striker in the world. The Belgian moved to Serie A giants Inter Milan from Manchester United and finished their topscorer, helping the team to the Europa League final. “When I step on to the pitch, I want to win. That means everything in Italy. There’s an enormous difference compared to the football approach in England, so here I can concentrate on what I am asked to do. In tactical terms, I mustn’t get my positioning or direction wrong. Ever. “Over the last five months, I would put myself in the list of the top five strikers in the world right now,” said Lukaku. “I don’t want to draw up a list of the others, but I see myself in there.” He continues: “I liked vertical football, as I am dangerous when I can face the goal. I’m quick and can dribble past my opponent, or move to the left or even the right. That’s where I played in the past, because I was with teams that focused a great deal on the counter-attack. “However, playing for Belgium forced me to modify my playing style. We rapidly became a side that focuses more on possession and that means there are fewer spaces to run into. “Roberto Martinez has done everything possible to make me feel more at my ease playing with my back to the goal, both for the national team and previously at Everton. I had a lot to learn at 20, but I soon realised that if I trained hard on that aspect of my game, I could do anything I wanted during a game. “Jose Mourinho taught me to work better with the collective, both in terms of pressing and my positioning. Just look at what he’s achieving with Harry Kane now at Tottenham.” Lukaku has scored 15 times in 18 competitive games for Inter this season, along with two assists.
