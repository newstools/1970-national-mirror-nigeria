According to him, he will never pay ransom to bandits even if they go as far to abduct his son.

In many declarations from the governor, he has said that band its do not stand a chance to live and should be dealt with force violently. On Friday, while passing the fascinating disclosure about not paying ransom even if his son is kidnapped, Mr El-Rufai said he had cautioned his family members to stay put to avoid being kidnapped. He said; “I mean it and I will say it again here. Even if my son is kidnapped, I will rather pray for him to make heaven instead, because I won’t pay any ransom.” The governor also said that the government is finding other ways to secure the release of the kidnapped students at the Federal College of Forestry Mechanisation, Kaduna when asked what the government is doing to help the students regain freedom. Meanwhile, he stressed that paying of ransoms for their immediate release is never an option. Mr El-Rufai has been under the heavy criticism of the parents of the students, other concerned persons and groups to negotiate with the bandits for the release of the students. Ghgossip understands that Zamfara, Niger, Katsina states negotiated with bandits to help kidnapped students regain freedom.
