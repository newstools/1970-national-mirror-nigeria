 Arsenal chiefs were instructed to back and not sack Mikel Arteta midway through Arsenal’s defeat by Everton. The Gunners are floundering near the Premier League’s relegation zone and Arteta is under increasing pressure. On Saturday Arsenal travelled to Goodison Park to take on Carlo Ancelotti’s Everton side. But they came away second best, with a Rob Holding own goal and Yerry Mina header gifting the Toffees all three points. Jamie Carragher was asked for his opinion on Arteta and whether he believes he should be sacked midway through the match on Sky Sports. And the Liverpool legend leaped to the defence of the Spaniard, saying the Gunners boss needs more time. “For [Arsenal] to get back to where they want to be, they will have to go through a lot of pain and they will do,” said the former Liverpool centre-back. “A couple of signings they made this season, Gabriel [Magalhaes], [Thomas] Partey, they could be a big part of Arsenal for years to come. “But they need a few more players in the January transfer window. If Arteta can get six or seven players in then he can be judged on the job that he’s doing.” Laying into the Gunners’ recruitment, which he doesn’t blame Arteta for, he added: “The recruitment has been shocking, absolutely shocking the last few years for Arsenal.” He recently spoke openly about the prospect of being sacked, saying he knows his number will be called at some point. “It’s something that the day I decided to be a coach I know that one day I will be sacked or leave the football club,” said Arteta. “I don’t know if it’s the day after I sign my contract, in a month’s time, a year’s time or six months’ time. I never worry about it. “My only concern is to get the best out of the players, give the best possible service to the club and become better and better. “I know, I repeat, in this profession, one day I will get the sack or leave but I don’t know when that is going to happen.”
