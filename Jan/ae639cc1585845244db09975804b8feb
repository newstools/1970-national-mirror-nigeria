 Bruno Fernandes is celebrating Manchester United 6-2 comeback win over AS Roma in the first of the Europa League semi-final at Old Trafford on Thursday night. The 26-year-old Portugal international has been in a consistent form for Ole Gunnar Solskjaerâ€™s men since arriving from Sporting Lisbon in January 2019. Manchester Unitedâ€™s semi-final curse under Solskjaer looked set to continue when Lorenzo Pellegriniâ€™s penalty and Edin Dzekoâ€™s sixth Old Trafford goal cancelled out Fernandesâ€™ brilliant opener to hand Roma two away goals before half-time. But Manchester United rallied after the break as Edison Cavani levelled with a superb first-time effort before Fernandes bagged another brace. Pogba then powered home a precise header from Fernandesâ€™ cross before Greenwood ran on to Cavaniâ€™s pass and drove home Unitedâ€™s sixth, making them the first side to score six goals in a major European semi-final since Real Madrid in the 1964 European Cup. Portugal midfielder took his social media handle to celebrate the first leg victory.
