 Double red cards for Arsenal as Wolves come from behind to beat Gunners 2-1 in the Premier League encounter on Tuesday night at Molineux Stadium. Bukayo Saka returns to Arsenal starting lineups after missing the goalless draw against Manchester United, while Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang makes it to the substitute bench. Nicolas Pepe shrugs off Nelson Semedo before jinking past Conor Coady and firing a left-footed curler into the side of the net to put Arsenal in from in the 32 minutes of the game. And Ruben Neves scored from the spot before halftime after David Luiz brings down Willian Jose as he runs through on goal and it’s a red card for the Arsenal defender. Moutinho picks the ball up from about 25 yards out and hits an unstoppable shot past Leno to make it 2-1 three minutes after the restart. Disaster for Arsenal as Bernd Leno comes to clear a long ball outside his area, but gets it all wrong and manages to clear it with his arm. Despite a VAR review, he’s sent off and Arsenal is down to nine men. Post Views:
