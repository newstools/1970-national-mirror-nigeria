 Minister of Information and culture The Federal Government of Nigeria has reacted to the United Kingdom’s plans to grant asylum to the members of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra. The stance of the Federal Government was made known by the Federal Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed. The UK took the decision to grant these people asylum considering the fact they have been labelled as a terrorist group and are being persecuted in Nigeria. He made this known in a recent interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) where he said; “As the spokesman for the Federal Government of Nigeria, I will say that if indeed the report that the UK will grant asylum to supposedly persecuted IPOB and MASSOB members is true, then something is wrong somewhere. Against the background of the fact that IPOB is not only proscribed but also designated as a terrorist organisation here in Nigeria, the UK’s decision is disrespectful of Nigeria as a nation. The decision amounts to sabotaging the fight against terrorism and generally undermining Nigeria’s security. It is not only unconscionable, it is inexplicable.”
