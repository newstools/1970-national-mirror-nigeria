It is a known fact that His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Dr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s administration in Enugu state came onboard at a time the Nation’s economy was wobbling, dangling and floundering in a manner only decipherable to the unseen beings. At such passing phase in our national life, some state governments across the federation even resorted to cutting down the cost of runnning governance in order to find a window through which they could survive the debilitating and daunting economic challenges posed by the biting situation we found ourselves. But despite these odds, His Excellency, Rt. Hon. Dr. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi( the man behind the masks, the Executive Governor of our dear state, was busy making his marks in virtually every facet of human endeavor, which included roads, buildings, rural infrastructure, health sector, workers’ welfare, security, education, response in covid-19, agriculture, empowerment, water, Housing, investment promotion, sports and so on. It is however, on record that during such period of national economic crunches, that Enugu state, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), on May 22, 2020, with no oil, became the 9th best performing state in terms of IGR. Available records have it that Enugu outperformed all oil producing states except Rivers, Delta and Akwa Ibom. Dear readers, it is with the above established positions that I would gladly want to run the rule on the massive infrastructural development and general overwhelming transformation of Enugu state by His Excellency, Rt.
