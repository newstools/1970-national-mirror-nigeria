 OSG Movie Review: Niyi Akinmolayan’s ‘The Prophetess’ Will Leave You Laughing And Emotional (Photo Credit: We finally got to see Niyi Akinmolayan’s ‘The Prophetess’ starring Toyin Abraham and it was totally worth our money and expensive popcorn (side eye at FilmHouse ). Produced by Victoria Akujobi, Mimi Bartels and Matilda Sola, the feature film follows the story of Ajoke Olooto (Toyin Abraham), a local prophetess whose prediction about a football match sets off a series of events that spirals beyond her control. This led to endangering her life and that of her family. Full of gang bangers and loads of rambunctious music, this comedic movie was somehow spun into a story of forgiveness, hope and understanding. P.S: Watch out for Kehinde Bankole! That lady owned the movie and even left us emotional at some point. What a performer! Toyin Abraham didn’t fall our hand, her use of body language and personality was everything. Let’s not forget the mixture of ‘Yorubawood’ and their Igbo counterparts who brought this movie to life. The entire cast did not disappoint! From the overly dramatic Uzor Arukwe to gang leader Deyemi Okanlawon (Fogo Bombastic) and Stan Nze everyone played their roles well! Although I think it was highly unnecessary that she had a lisp. It just pushes the narrative and stereotype that people with speech disorders be used as comic relief. Action packed with comedic interludes, Prophetess stars Kehinde Bankole, Kunle Remi, Ronke Ojo, Tina Mba, Stan Nze, Uzor Arukwe, Deyemi Okanlawon, Adedimeji Lateef, Blessing Jessica Obasi, Seyi Awolowo, Toyin Abraham and others. If you want to lift your mood this weekend or just need a good laugh, please go see ‘The Prophetess’.
