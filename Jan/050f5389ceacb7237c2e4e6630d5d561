(Source: Facebook/Mai Mala-Buni) Yobe state government have started the distribution of 1,780 goats to 890 women under the rural empowerment programme. Governor of the state, Mai Mala-Buni said that five women from each of the 178 wards in the state would receive two goats each. Aimed at increasing the income level of women in the state and making them self-reliant, the occasion held in Gujiba on Tuesday, December 22, 2020. Mala-Buni warned the beneficiaries against selling the goats to solve immediate problems. “These are investments into your future; you should also resist sugar-coated tongues of some husbands who may advise you to sell the goats immediately just to borrow the money. “You should allow the goats to multiply and support your family needs,” he said. Earlier, the Commissioner for Women Affairs, Hajiya Hauwa Abubakar, thanked the governor for targeting women in the empowerment programme.
