 Oyo State Governor, Mr Seyi Makinde Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, on Wednesday, said the government had opened discussions with a manufacturing company, Astra-Zeneca, with a view to directly procuring COVID-19 vaccines for residents of the state. Speaking during a media briefing held at the Government House, Ibadan, Makinde said the state decided to go directly, considering that the 1,800 vaccines meant for Oyo State from the 100,000 vaccines procured by the Federal Government will be inadequate. He added that the move was also because the state does not have the facilities to store the procured vaccines of the Federal Government at the required minus 70 degrees centigrade. Makinde said: “If you want to vaccinate 100,000 people out of a population of 200 million, it won’t make much difference. For Oyo State with a population of between seven million and 12 million, 1,800 vaccines won’t go anywhere.
