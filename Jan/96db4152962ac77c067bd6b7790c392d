 Jose Mourinho’s Tottenham return from the defeat to Liverpool to face a tricky Leicester City side and our partners Betpay is bringing you the preview and betting tips. Tottenham Hotspur missed out on going clear at the top of the Premier League (PL) when losing 2-1 to Liverpool (Dec 16), their first league defeat since the opening round (W7, D4). That was also the first time they’d conceded more than once in eight PL matches, and Liverpool’s late winner was Tottenham’s seventh second-half goal conceded (of nine) this term to come after the 75th minute. The only PL side yet to concede a first-half goal at home (HT: W5, D1), ‘Spurs’ are undefeated here in five league matches (W3, D2). Unsurprisingly, they’ve avoided defeat in 80% of PL home games entered as favourites this term and they’ve only lost one of the last seven league H2Hs as hosts (W4, D2). Leicester City’s 2-0 defeat to Everton (Dec 16) included more set-piece struggles – they’ve conceded seven PL goals from corners this term, two more than they did throughout last season. But having scored a league-high nine goals this term after the 75th minute, they will aim to profit from their hosts’ late-game issues. A joint league-high seven of those goals prior to this round have contributed to their excellent away form this term (W5, L1), while their away league fixtures have produced an entertaining average of 3.67 goals per game. Meanwhile, prior to this round, only Manchester United have scored in both halves away from home more often than the ‘Foxes’ this season (three). Odds A Tottenham win is priced at 2.15 odds and if you were to stake on a draw, that would attract odds of 3.75. however, for a Leicester win, there are odds of 3.50, all on Betpay. Betting Tip Tottenham are in incredible form, never mind the loss to Liverpool the last time and our tipsters have tipped them for a win here and you can stake on it on Betpay with odds of 2.15.
