 Prince David Osei Ghanaian Actor Prince David Osei has appeals to President Nana Akufo-Addo in a new Facebook post, saying that the Nana Akufo Addo-led government has made people like himself and others look “mindless” for campaigning vigorously for him in the 2020 general elections. His statement is hinged on the new taxes the government has imposed despite the worsening economic situation in the country. The government, right on the heels of the free water and electricity he provided the citizenry to alleviate them of the inconveniences the Covid-19 and subsequent lockdown brought, immediately introduced these taxes to recoup money lost in the process. This new development has caused an uproar on social media and while reacting, the actor labeled himself and all those who campaigned for Nana Akuffo Addo ‘mindless’ for suddenly switching allegiance to the elephant family in the build-up to the elections.
