In 2020, the Nigerian House of Representatives passed a resolution calling on all military service chiefs to resign. If not, the resolution called on Buhari to fire them. I have accepted the immediate resignation of the Service Chiefs, and their retirement from service. I thank them all for their overwhelming achievements in our efforts at bringing enduring peace to Nigeria, and wish them well in their future endeavours. — Muhammadu Buhari (@MBuhari) January 26, 2021
