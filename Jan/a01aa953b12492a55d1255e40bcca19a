 Yoruba Council of Elders has faulted the meeting which the governors in the South-West zone had with Miyetti Allah Breeders Association of Nigeria in Akure, Ondo state, two days ago. The Elders registered their displeasure in a statement signed by its Secretary-General, Dr Kunle Olajide in Ibadan. YCE noted with grave concern and reservation the meeting of the Governors Forum with MACBAN held in Akure on the 25th of January, 2021. The eldersâ€™ association argued that in a crisis situation, all parties should be invited to any peace meeting convened so as to calm all frayed nerves. Vanguard News Nigeria
