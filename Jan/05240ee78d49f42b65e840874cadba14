 Super Eagles star Peter Olayinka has reacted after winning the battle of Nigerians after scoring in Slavia Prague 2-0 win over Leon Balogun and Joe Aribo’s Rangers in the last 16-second leg of Europa League on Thursday night. Steven Gerrard’s side may have held a slight advantage after drawing the first leg 1-1 in the Czech capital last week, that is until the 25-year-old Nigeria international headed the Czech champions ahead after 17 minutes. However, Nicolae Stanciu doubled the advantage for Slavia Prague after Leon Balogun was shown a second yellow and Kemer Roofe giving the marching order as the away side make it 3-1 on aggregate after the first leg ended 1-1. Olayinka took his social media handle to celebrate reaching the quater-final after knocking his fellow Super Eagles teammates of Balogun and Aribo’s Rangers exiting Europe’s second-tier at the same stage last year. Slavia’s Olayinka has been involved in six goals in his last nine appearances in Europe with four goals and two assists. Post Views:
