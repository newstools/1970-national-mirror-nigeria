 Following their dismal 1-3 defeat to Arsenal on Boxing Day, Chelsea welcome Aston Villa to Stamford Bridge and our partners Betpay brings you the preview and betting tips. Despite finding any form of silverware elusive so far this calendar year, Chelsea can claim to be one of the most improved home teams in the league. They have averaged 2.25 points per home league game played in 2020, which is up drastically from the 1.32 attained per Premier League (PL) home game in 2019. Usually wasting no time in the act of picking up points, Chelsea have scored their first goal of the game before the 30th minute in each of their last five PL wins, thrice doing so specifically within the 20th-29th minute period. Superstitious Aston Villa fans can look to the last time they closed a calendar year here for inspiration, with a 3-1 victory on New Years’ Eve 2011 standing solitary amongst their last 16 visits here (W1, D3, L12). They averaged 3.75 ‘goals against’ across the last eight defeats therein, of which six saw them concede the +1 handicap. The visitors have won five (L1) of their last six PL away games, with the last four wins seeing them average 1.00 goals per match beyond the 80th minute. So too did they score from a penalty in that same late period in the last two. A win here will see the 146-year-old club record two separate runs of 3+ top-flight away league wins in a single season for the first time ever. Odds Chelsea are priced 1.85 odds for the win while a draw gets 4.40 odds and an Aston Villa win gets 4.30 odds on Betpay. Betting Tip Villa are in fine form and come into this game on the back of a 3-0 defeat of Crystal Palace while Chelsea come in on the back of a 1-3 defeat to Arsenal. Bookies have booked a win or a draw for Aston Villa and Betpay is offering odds of 2.10 for that possibility. Prediction Chelsea 1-2 Aston Villa
