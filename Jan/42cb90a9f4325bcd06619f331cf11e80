Daddy Adejare be calming down for us! AG can definitely be a fine baby… Oh is that a black angel we see, oh it’s AG Baby! Putting the pacs on display. Looking like Africa’s Denzel Washington in leather pants. You know what they say about Silk shirts “They look good on Adekunle Gold”. You can’t sit on our table with no beards.
