 Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has revealed administration’s plan in facing the Coronavirus disease. Sanwo-Olu made it known in a fresh interview with Channels TV that there is no need to vaccinate 20 or 22 million people. He revealed that the plan is to ensure that there is herd immunity. According to him, some companies have been reached out to provide COVID-19 vaccines for residents. He said; “It is important for me to make this. We don’t have to vaccinate the 20 or 22 million population that we have. The plan is to ensure that there is herd immunity and that typically speaks about 50 to 60 percent of your population, that is the kind of target that you really meet. “We have started a conversation with some of the vaccine manufacturers. Pfizer for example, I have made contact with them, Johnson and Johnson are not out yet, the Moderna has written to us and we have written back to them.” Speaking of how the vaccines would be funded by the State Governments, Sanwo-Olu said that they are in talks with organised private sectors. He said; “The conversations are still at various levels. We are speaking with the organised private sector so they can help us raise some of the finance that is required. “We have our friends in the private sector who are saying to us that they understand this is a public health issue but we also can work with you. The citizens are your citizens but they also are our staff”
