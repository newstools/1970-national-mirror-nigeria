In partnership with its beneficiary organizations, a 10-year implementation plan has been put in place to guide the over 5 billion Naira raised at the Cuppy Gold Gala which premiered in November 2019 in Abuja, Nigeria. This plan covers key states in Nigeria and is focused on the foundation’s thematic areas. From 2019 over 9000 unique persons have been reached via various programs supported by the Cuppy Foundation. Some of the ways in which impact has been made include; several individuals with physical disabilities have been sponsored through higher institutions, children have been treated for acute malnutrition, young mothers have been educated on how to cater for their children, as well as the refurbishment of several health facilities and supplies of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) materials for COVID-19. This and much more was achieved by The Cuppy Foundation in the year 2020 here.      —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————-Sponsored Content
