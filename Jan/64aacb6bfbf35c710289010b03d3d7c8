 Fulham put in a hard fight to earn a 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield in their Premier League match on Sunday. A first-half goal from Mario Lemar ensured that the visitor took the lead to the second half of the game. Liverpool mounted a high pressure on the Fulham backline but the away team was solid defensively as they absorbed all pressure from the Premier League Champions. Sadio Mane was presented with a scoring chance but he was denied by the crossbar as Mohamed Salah was constantly kept at bay by the Fulham defence. Post Views:
