 Big blow for Peter Olayinka’s Slavia Prague teammate Ondrej Kudela after he was banned for 10 games by UEFA for racist abuse towards Rangers’ Glen Kamara. The 34-year-old is a Czech international e found guilty of racist behaviour towards Rangers’ Glen Kamara at Ibrox Stadium in the Europa League last month. Kudela has denied the allegations that he racially abused Joe Aribo and Leon Balogun Rangers’ teammate after serving one match in the quarter-final first leg 1-1 scored with Arsenal at Emirate Stadium last week Thursday. Slavia, who won the match 2-0 to advance to the quarter-finals 3-1 on aggregate, have denied the claims and said earlier this month they would file a criminal complaint against Kamara for allegedly attacking Kudela in the tunnel after the game.  According to Sky Sports Kudela will now be ineligible for the next nine games played by either Slavia in Europe or his country Czech Republic, including this summer’s European Championship. Kamara has been suspended for three games after he was found guilty of assaulting Kudela after the match. His ban only covers UEFA club competitions, meaning he will be eligible to represent Finland at the Euros as boths sanctions are open to appeal. Olayinka and Slavia Prague will be hoping to overcome to reach the semi-final for Europa League on Thursday night. Post Views:
