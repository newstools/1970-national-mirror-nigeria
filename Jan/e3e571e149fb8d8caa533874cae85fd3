 President Muhammadu Buhari The Federal Government of Nigeria has explained the rationale behind the charges and levies imposed on Nigerians in diaspora at the foreign missions. The FG stated that these charges and levies are due to how funds are scarce to run operations at these missions. This was revealed by The Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyema; and the Controller-General of the Nigeria Immigration Service, Muhammed Babandede when they both appeared before the House of Representatives Committee on Foreign Affairs in Abuja on Tuesday. In his submission, the Federal Minister of Foreign Affairs indicated that the charges had been in existence and were only suspended. He said; “The $100 they (Nigerians in the US) said has been added is voluntary; it is just for those who want to have their biometrics done without an appointment. If you wait for your appointment, you will get it (done) and not pay. But if you want it the same day, then pay $100.” On his part, the NIS boss decried the shortage of passport booklets, which he described as the biggest challenge facing the service. He also said; “The passport is the biggest challenge. When we talk about passports, the challenges are ours; some of the challenges are with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and some are with Nigerians themselves. On our side, we have the huge challenge of scarcity of passport booklets.”
