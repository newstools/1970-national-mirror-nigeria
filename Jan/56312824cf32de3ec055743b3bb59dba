I dnt see AC Milan beating Atlanta and Juventus can’t win with a 10goals margin. All Napoli needs to do is just a win to send Juve to Europa.

Atalanta vs Ac Milan
Bologna vs Juventus Napoli = Straight win
Atalanta = win or draw.
Juventus = straight win. So, I see Napoli , Atalanta, Juventus qualify. 💯 — Babatunde Solomon (@Rename07) May 17, 2021 You will play!
