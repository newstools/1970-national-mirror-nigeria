Facebook and Twitter took the extraordinary step on Wednesday of temporarily locking President Donald Trump’s account on their platforms after his supporters stormed the Capitol building to protest the election. “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great,” the Facebook CEO wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “Therefore, we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.” If the latest restrictions hold, Facebook could be the first major platform to remove Trump permanently.
