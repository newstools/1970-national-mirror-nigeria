 Stella Oduah The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) will, on Feb. 22, arraign former Minister of Aviation, Sen. Stella Oduah, in the Federal High Court, Abuja, for alleged financial impropriety. The date was fixed by Justice Inyang Ekwo on Tuesday because the former Minister was yet to be summoned. Oduah who presently represents the Anambra North Senatorial District at the National Assembly has been called upon along with eight others in a suit with number: FHC/ABJ/CR/316/20. Counsel to the EFCC, Dr Hassan Liman, SAN, told the court that the ex-minister had not been served with the court processes. The lawyer, therefore, prayed for an adjournment to enable the anti-graft agency to serve the legislator. “My lord, the matter has been set out today for arraignment but I have been informed by the commission that the first defendant (Oduah) is yet to be served. In view of that my lord, may I humbly apply for a very short date,” he said. Justice Ekwo held that it was the duty of the prosecution to produce defendants in court. The judge then adjourned the matter until Feb. 22 for defendants to take their plea. The anti-corruption agency is alleging that Oduah misappropriated public funds while serving as minister.
