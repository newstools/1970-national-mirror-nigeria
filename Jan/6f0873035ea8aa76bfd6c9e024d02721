 Manchester United new signing Amad Diallo says he is ready for the challenge following his £37million move from Atalanta last week. The 18-year-old expressed excitement about joining the Red Devils and has been given the No 19 shirt – previously worn by the likes of Marcus Rashford and Dwight Yorke. ‘After waiting since the summer, it is finally a dream come true to complete my move to Manchester United,’ said Diallo last week. ‘I am hugely ambitious and there is so much that I want to achieve in the game; when I spoke to the manager I knew that I had joined the perfect club. ‘This is a really exciting squad with so many great players, I can promise that I will work hard every day to learn from them and give everything to develop my game. ‘The coaches have been fantastic since I signed, we have been in touch regularly and they have already given me a lot of great advice. I have had time to prepare for this move, both physically and mentally, and I have worked really hard to be ready to make the step up to this amazing club.’ Man United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: ‘As a club, we have followed Amad for a number of years and having watched him myself, I believe he is one of the most exciting young prospects in the game,’ said Solskjaer. ‘Manchester United has such a proud history of developing young players and everything is in place to enable Amad to reach his potential here. ‘It’s important we give him that time to settle in, if it’s in the Under 23s or if he looks ready to go into the first team, I don’t know yet.’ Manchester United paid £19m up front for Amad Diallo and could pay up to £18m in add-ons, should he meet certain targets.
