 Enyimba have suffered a heavy away defeat in Omdurman after losing 3-0 to Al Merreikh in the first leg of their first-round CAF Champions League clash on Wednesday afternoon. The Sudanese club take the lead in the seven minutes into the encounter through Saif Terry before the forward doubled his side lead on the 44th minutes with a counter-attack. Enyimba coach Fatai Osho made double substitution by bringing in Adebayo for Yarou and Tosin Omoyele in for Obi five minutes after the restart of the second stanza of the game to score an away goal. However, Al Merreikh defended very before they compound the Peoples Elephant woes through Terry in the 89 minutes to completes his hat-trick in the first leg encounter in Sudan. The return leg is in a fortnight with the overall winners advancing to the money-spinning group stage of the Champions League, while losers drop to the second-tier CAF Confederation Cup.
