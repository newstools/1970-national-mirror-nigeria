 Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain is prepared to hijack Real Madrid target David Alaba, according to the report. The Ligue 1 outfit is ready to knock Real Madrid off the patch to get Alaba on board with the club ready to offer a €25 million per season contract. The report in Calciomercato claims that Paris Saint-Germain has joined the race to land the Austrian defender who is set to leave the Allianz Arena in the summer on a free transfer.

Alaba wants a pay rise which is his main reason why he plans to quit Bayern Munich with the Bavarian unwilling to meet his demand. Real Madrid, though, remain the favourites as they can offer Alaba the opportunity to replace the legendary Sergio Ramos. The ageing defender could be on his way out of Bernabeu after struggling to agree to a new contract – paving the way for the Bayern Munich man to quickly establish himself as one of the most crucial assets in one of the biggest teams in European football.
