 Embattled Flying Eagles coach, Ladan Bosso has assured the country will bounce back to winning ways in age-group football after the country’s U-20 and U-17 struggle to keep up with their West African counterparts. He then lauded NFF decision to build on the positives after the Flying Eagles crashed out of the U20 AFCON Qualifiers WAFU B in Benin – falling out of both next year’s U20 AFCON in Mauritania and the U20 World Cup in Indonesia. The former Wikki Tourist coach absolved the FA of any blame on the ground of Covid-19 outbreak, which according to him slowed down his side’s preparation for the competition. ” NFF did their best and I want to believe we will bounce back in age-group football in no time” Bosso begin Lots of factors came into play; we did not start preparations due to the lockdown. We will pick the positives and move on,” he said. It would be recalled that the country’s soccer governing body is miffed that Nigeria is fast losing its dominance in age-grade football after coach Fatai Amoo’s tutored Golden Eaglets also struggled in their two group matches at the on-going West Africa tourney in Togo. Faced with elimination from the tourney, Golden Eaglets’s will be banking on Ghana to beat Ivory Coast to help ease Nigeria into the semi-finals after picking one point from a possible six.
