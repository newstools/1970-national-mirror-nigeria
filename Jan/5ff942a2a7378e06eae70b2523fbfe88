 The Nigeria U-17 team on Thursday stepped up their preparation for the upcoming AFCON U-17 in Morocco with another friendly game. The Golden Eaglets showed great potentials as they trounced Bayern Munich Academy, Nigeria 5-1 in a friendly game played at the River plate football ground, Wuse 2, Abuja on Thursday. Both sides failed to score in the first 45 minutes before the Eaglets came out smoking for the second half. Victor Udoh set the tone for the day; scoring in the 46th minute, but Chinasa Maduabuchi equalised for his side in the 67th min. Ahmed Abdullahiâ€™s sublime header sailed into the net two minutes later and he scored from the spot in the 75th to complete his brace. Peter Asuquo was also clinical with his goal from the spot six minutes from full time, while Gideon Atoyebi hit the roof of the net in added time to complete the demolition of Bayern Munich Academy boys.
