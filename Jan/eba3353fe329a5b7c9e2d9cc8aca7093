 Super Eagles defender Leon Balogun has been suspended against Peter Olayinka’s Slavia Prague in the UEFA Europa League Round of 16 first leg tie at Sinobo Stadium. The 32-year-old Nigeria international has been a regular for Steven Gerard’s Rangers after making 25 appearances so far this season. Rangers will hope to continue their fine run in Europe in the Czech Republic but without the Balogun, after receiving his second booking during the 5-2 win over Royal Antwerp in the last 32. However, Balogun’s fellow Nigeria international Joe Aribo will be available for selection for the newly crowned Scottish champions. Both players have been called up by the Super Eagles for AFCON qualifiers against Benin and Lesotho later this month. Slavia Prague will also line up another Nigeria star, Peter Olayinka, in a first-ever clash between the two sides. Post Views:
