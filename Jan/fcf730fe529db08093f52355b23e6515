 Barcelona may not be able to offer Lionel Messi the same amount from interested clubs and that may see the Argentine leave the club this summer, according to presidential candidate Joan Laporta. The 6-time Ballon D’Or winner has played for more than two decades in Catalonia and his current deal will expire at the end of the season unless a new contract can be agreed. Messi wanted to force a move away from Barcelona last term amid interest from Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain but the club prevailed on him to stay but renewing his contract maybe too much for the club that is suffering financially. “It won’t be easy because he’s receiving offers from clubs that don’t lack money, because they have either a tycoon or a state behind them,” he said in a campaign speech. “Messi is very comfortable here, I’m convinced. From what I know of him, he wants to stay. He loves Barcelona and I enjoy the honesty he has always spoken to me with.” Messi has scored 16 times with seven assists in 25 appearances for Barcelona this season. Post Views:
