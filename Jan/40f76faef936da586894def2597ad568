 Latest transfer news suggests that Chelsea are mulling the option of making a move to sign Bayern Munich defender David Alaba on a free transfer in the summer. Alaba, 28, is out of contract at Bayern in the summer and Real Madrid have offered a lucrative four-year deal but he is still deliberating over his final decision. According to sportsmail earlier this month, Liverpool, Chelsea and Manchester United are said to be among those vying after the Austrian international’s signature. Now Sky Sports are also reporting Chelsea are ‘definitely in the mix’ to sign the player, claiming that some of the agents involved in bringing new manager Thomas Tuchel to Stamford Bridge this week are also involved with Alaba. While his next destination is not certain, more than ever before, Alaba looks set to end his stay with Bundesliga giants Bayern at the end of the season after 13 years. Post Views:
