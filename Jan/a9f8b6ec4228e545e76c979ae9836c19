 Former Arsenal forward, Afobe has advised Super Eagles prospect Folarin Balogun to leave the Gunners in the summer. The highly sort after striker is not getting first team opportunities under Mikel Arteta apart from a couple of Europa League appearances. However, Afobe reckons that it would be hard for him to break into the first team and should seek a move away from the club amid interest from major European sides. “It all depends on your positioning and who’s ahead of you… Balogun, he’s good, I’ve seen him play,” Afobe told The Beautiful Game Podcast.  “I think it’s the right decision for him to leave. The captain [Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang] is a number nine, the other number nine is top goalscorer this season, [Alexandre] Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah is a couple of years older than him and has also done well.” Post Views:
