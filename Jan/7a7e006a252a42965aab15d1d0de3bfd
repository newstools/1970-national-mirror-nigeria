 Peruzzi (Source: Instagram/Peruzzi) Nigerian music star Peruzzi in a recent interview has recounted how he lost N400,000 sent to him by Davido for his Dubai trip to a taxi driver. The singer revealed all this during a chat with Chude Jideonwo on his show ‘WithChude. According  to  him, Davido had requested for him to come to Dubai as it was the first time they were going to meet. According to him, Davido requested for his account details to make the necessary arrangements for his trip to Dubai, then he made a mistake. “So he told me that I should come to Dubai. Because when he called me I was in the room doing nothing. He asked ‘do you have a passport?’ I said I don’t have a passport and he said okay that he would call somebody,” he said. “Then I got the passport the next day. Then he said ‘send your account for ticket. Me very useless guy at that time. I didn’t have any account, I was using different accounts. The account number I copied was the Uber guy that carried me. Omo Uber guy switched off his phone after collecting 400k. I was like my ticket money is gone! I was looking for the Uber guy on Facebook. I went crazy. I went to Uber’s office and they said they had stopped the guy from working like a month ago. I was like where will I see 400k? What will I tell this guy that I just met? He would think that I have spent the money.” He narrated how he eventually told Davido what happened and how he sent the ticket money the second time. Shout out to Davido!
