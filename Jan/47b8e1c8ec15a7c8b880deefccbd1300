 BET announces the “BET AWARDS” 2021 nominees with African heavyweights Wizkid, Burnaboy (Nigeria) and Diamond Platinumz (Tanzania) scoring three nominations in the Best International Act category. This year’s nominees reflect an abundance of creative expression and Black excellence across music, television, film, and sports. The “BET AWARDS” 2021 will air LIVE, Monday, June 28 on BET Africa, DStv channel 122, at 1am WAT / 2am CAT. You can also catch the repeat at 7pm WAT / 8pm CAT on Monday, June 28. Culture’s biggest night, the “BET AWARDS,” continues its reign in its twenty-first year as the ultimate platform to showcase the best, brightest, and most beautiful aspects of the Black experience – celebrating Black music’s present and future, while elevating the culture and being a driving force for social change. “It’s been a thrilling year in music entertainment and we are proud to have this opportunity to showcase a diverse and cultural rich list of international nominees that includes African artists and including Brazil talent for the first time in the Best International Act Category,“ said Monde Twala, Senior Vice President & GM ViacomCBS and BET International Peer Lead. “Over the years, the BET Awards have honoured some of the most talented musicians in the International arena. It’s a powerful platform to spotlight and celebrate black excellence on the global stage. Congratulations to all the nominees.” American rappers Megan Thee Stallion and DaBaby are also leading the pack with seven nominations respectively. Megan Thee Stallion, who left her mark in last year’s telecast with her Mad Max inspired performance for “Girls in The Hood” and “Savage,” claims one of the top spots securing seven nominations for ‘Best Female Hip Hop Artist,’ ‘Video of the Year,’ for WAP, ‘Album of the Year,’ for Good News, ‘Viewer’s Choice Award (x2),’ and ‘Best Collaboration,’ for her features with DaBaby (Cry Baby) and Cardi B (WAP). After his searing and powerful ‘Rockstar’ performance at last year’s “BET Awards,” DaBaby claims the other top spot securing seven nods, including ‘Best Male Hip Hop Artist,’ ‘Album of the Year,’ for Blame it on Baby, ‘Viewer’s Choice Award,’ and four nods for ‘Best Collaboration’ for his features alongside Roddy Ricch (Rockstar), Megan Thee Stallion (Cry Baby), Pop Smoke & Lil Baby (For The Night), and Jack Harlow Tory Lanez & Lil Wayne (Whats Poppin- Remix).
