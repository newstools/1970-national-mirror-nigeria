 Diego Maradona had no traces of alcohol or illegal drugs in his blood and urine when he died, it has emerged. But he was suffering major heart, liver and kidney problems. And the blood and urine tests carried out after a post-mortem following the soccer star’s November 25 death did show up a cocktail of prescription drugs including Quetiapine, Venlafaxine and Levetiracetam. Some of the pills had already been named as being among those the former Naples and Barcelona star is thought to have been taking in the run-up to his untimely death at a rented home near Buenos Aires following a hospital brain blood clot op. Quetiapine is used to treat mood disorders including depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Antidepressant Venlaxfaxine is sometimes used to treat panic attacks. Levitiracetam belongs to a class of drugs known as anticonvulsants and is used with other medication to treat epilepsy and try to decrease the number of seizures. The drug Ranitidine was also detected, which is used for indigestion and heartburn but is not currently available in the UK and is the focus of an ongoing investigation into whether some ingredients can increase the risk of cancer. Although some of the drugs found in his system can cause arrhythmia, the tests have confirmed there is no evidence Maradona was being given medication for the heart disease he was suffering. The retired footballer’s dire state of health was laid bare in the report compiled on the back of the follow-up toxicology tests, showing Maradona was suffering liver cirrhosis, a kidney disorder called acute tubular necrosis which can lead to acute kidney failure, coronary artery disease and myocardial fibrosis. It had already been reported that his heart weighed 503 grams, almost double that of a normal heart for a man his age. A doctor who asked not to be named told local press: “His body was on the edge. Or over the edge.”
