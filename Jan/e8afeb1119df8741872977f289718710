 Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi scored as Leicester City beat Chelsea 2-0 to go top of the Premier League table. Chelsea who narrowly beat 10-man Fulham at the weekend looked to continue their claim on the log when they traveled to the King Power Stadium but the Foxes had other ideas. Ndidi put the home side in front with a superb left foot shot from the edge of the box to hand his side the lead before Maddison made it 2-0 before half-time. The second half did not produce any goals after Timo Wernerâ€™s strike was ruled out for offside by the Video Assistant Referee (VAR). With the victory Leicester City are now top of the Premier League with 38points while Chelsea is eighth with 29points. Post Views:
