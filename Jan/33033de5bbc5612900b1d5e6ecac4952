 AbdulRasheed Bawa The chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has vowed to resign his appointment should he be asked to act against his conscience or in violation of rule of law. An EFCC’s statement shared via the commission’s twitter handle on Saturday stated that Mr Bawa spoke on Friday, while featuring on a Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) special interview programme, ‘One-on-One’. A PREMIUM TIMES report had highlighted obedience to rule of law and independent working relationship with the Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami, and others, as two of the 10 things Nigerians’ expected of Mr Bawa-led EFCC following his appointment late February. Addressing these concerns in his NTA interview, Mr Bawa said, “rule of law and fear of God shall be his guiding principles”. “I will continue to do what is right,” he said, adding, “The commission under my watch will continue to abide by the rule of law. If anybody asks me to do anything contrary to my conscience or against the rule of law, I will resign my appointment.” ‘No going back on bankers’ assets declaration’ Mr Bawa also said there was no going back the directive that all bankers should start declaring their assets as from June 1, 2021. He said bankers were not expected to declare their assets to EFCC, but to the “statutory bodies”, details of which he did not give. He added that the “laws permit the commission to investigate assets of public officers including bankers”. He said, “There is a law called Bank Employee Declaration of Assets, Act 1986. We are not saying they should declare their assets to us. What we are saying is that they should declare it to the statutory bodies. We are going to be calling for it.
