The Black Lives Matter protests which was revived across the United Sates of America and some other countries between May – August of 2020 has been nominated for the prestigious Nobel Peace Prize award. The Black Lives Matter movement was cofounded in 2013 by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi to protest the acquittal of George Zimmerman’s homicide charges after he fatally shot Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager, in Florida. The movement and its #BlackLivesMatter hashtag has gained recognition globally over the years and erupted in 2020 after George Floyd’s death at the hands of police, which ignited a racial reckoning in the U.S. and around the world. In response to the nomination, the organization wrote via Twitter: “We hold the largest social movement in global history. Today, we have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. People are waking up to our global call: for racial justice and an end to economic injustice, environmental racism, and white supremacy.
We’re only getting started” We hold the largest social movement in global history. Today, we have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.
