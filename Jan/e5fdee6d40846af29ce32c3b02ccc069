The 2021 Nollywood Week Film Festival took place virtually between Thursday, May 6 and Sunday, May 9, and we are glad to see so many pioneering Nollywood films written, produced, and directed by Nigerians get screened. Nollywood Week is a yearly film festival that showcases the best of the Nigerian film industry with the aim of finding a larger audience and a more sustainable distribution system for these quality films. The NWFF panel interviewed the directors, cast, and producers of the films that screened at the festival. They were able to share fascinating details about their film. Watch the videos below:
