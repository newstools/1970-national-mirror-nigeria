 Victor Osimhen is reportedly battling other issues apart from being treated for Covid-19 symptoms in Naples. A report by Tuttomecartowebb on Wednesday revealed that things may be worse than perceived presently. Indeed, Osimhen’s days in Napoli physio room may not be over soon after the club detected a nerve and ligaments injury and the former Lille forward have been told to endure longer time in the stands. Osimhen’s had dislocated his shoulder in Nigeria’s 4-4 draw with Sierra Leone during AFCON 2022 qualifiers last November and had it remedied in autumn but La Gazzetta Dello Sport reported that nerves and ligament injury has slowed down his full recovery. The club eggheads have informed team doctor to exercise caution in their handling of the injury that prevents the star striker from moving his arm and right hand well. A situation that, therefore, risks keeping the highest-paid signing in the history of Napoli off the pitch for weeks or even months. It remains to be seen how team doctors intend to ensure their prized striker recover early enough and hit the ground running as AC Milan lead the pack in Italian Serie A. Osimhen who scored 18 goals in 38 appearances for Lille in the 2019-20 season, joined Napoli last summer in a deal reported to be worth €50 million (£45m/$59m). The Nigeria international Osimhen only joined Lille last summer from Charleroi for just €12m but had an excellent season in France with 13 league goals. Osimhen previously spent two seasons at Bundesliga side VfL Wolfsburg, where he made his debut in 2017, before moving to Charleroi. Post Views:
