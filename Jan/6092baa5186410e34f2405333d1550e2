 ‘If You Have Opportunity To Leave Nigeria Please Do’ – Joe Abah Former Nigerian Director-General of Bureau of Public Sector Reform, Dr Joe Abah is advising young Nigerians to leave the country if they have an opportunity to do so. In a series of tweets, Abah recounted his own experience after leaving the country. He wrote, “Moving abroad the 1st time, I didn’t watch any in-flight movie. My eyes were firmly on the flight display. As soon as we left Nigeria, I made the sign of the Cross. When we left Africa, I whispered “Alleluia! If this plane does emergency landing now, it won’t be in Africa sha!” It’s true that when I got to the UK for the first time, I thought “Is this all?” However, I could see a clear path to how I could own a car, buy a house and build a career. I couldn’t see that path as a young man in Nigeria. I still don’t see it for many young Nigerians now.” He also advised those who want to return to Nigeria, to do so by choice. “In your youth, you should japa if you want to and have an opportunity to do so. Get the basics, like a car, a house, a 90-inch TV and a bad bad sound system. Build your CV there & show them you are a determined Naija person. If, later, you want to come back, it’ll be by choice.” Moving abroad the 1st time, I didn’t watch any in-flight movie. My eyes were firmly on the flight display.
