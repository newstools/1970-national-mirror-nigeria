 Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi achieved yet another record in La Liga when he surpassed the appearance number by former teammate Xavi Hernandes. The six-time Ballon D’Or winner marked his 506th game with a goal but it didn’t end in a victory as he would’ve liked as a late goal by Cadiz ensured the encounter finished 1-1 at Nou Camp. However, Messi’s goal drew him level with his old friend and Atletico Madrid forward Luis Suarez in the Pichichi race, with 16. The Argentine is still some distance from the top five of record appearance holders in Spanish football’s top flight, however. Andoni Zubizarreta has 622, Joaquin has 567, Raul has 550, Eusebio Sacristan has 543 and Paco Buyo has 542. Messi has played 21 games in La Liga so far this 2020/21 season, scoring 16 goals and contributing three assists. The next record he’s chasing is another of Xavi’s, that of the player with the most official appearances for Barcelona. Xavi has 767 to his name, while Messi is currently at 758, nine away. Andres Iniesta is next on the list in terms of league appearances for Barcelona, with 442. Post Views:
