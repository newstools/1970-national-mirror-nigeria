 Real Madrid star Marcelo could miss the return leg clash against Chelsea due to a polling station commitment ahead of elections in the city of Madrid. Real Madrid is scheduled to take on Chelsea for the second leg against the Blues at Stamford Bridge but Marcelo will be working at a polling station that day ahead of the elections to the Madrid Assembly. Vinicius sends warning to Chelsea ahead of Champions League tie Los Blancos directors have launched an appeal to excuse Marcelo from this commitment, but they have not yet received official authorisation. Marcelo could alternatively travel alone on May 5, with his Real Madrid teammates already in London. The electoral participants due to work at a polling station can be excused for professional reasons, such as for taking part in essential services to the community, like healthcare services.
