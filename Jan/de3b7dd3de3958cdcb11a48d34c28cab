 Former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has predicted Kylian Mbappe greatness in the future, according to a report in Marca. Wengers believe that the young lad will develop into one of the finest players in the world in the future regardless of where his future lies. “Kylian will be one of the best in the world,” Wenger told Le Parisien. “As he matures he will move centrally… especially with age, his efficiency will increase. “Whether it’s in Paris or Madrid or… How many Ballon d’Ors will he win? I want to know.” The likes of Real Madrid and Liverpool are credited with interest for a move for the attacker, with the World Cup winner yet to extend his deal with the Ligue 1 Champions.
