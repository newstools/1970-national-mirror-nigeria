 Romelu Lukaku’s teammate at Inter midfielder Nicolo Barella has compared the Belgian to Basketball icon Shaquille O’Neal. The Italian international is however in awe of Lukaku’s talent and tagged him ‘a force of nature.’ Barella talked about the former Manchester United forward’s physical strength as he praised him, who has contributed 50 goals and nine assists in 72 games since his move from Manchester United. “Lukaku and Shaquille O’Neal make physical power their greatest strength,” Barella told DAZN. “But Romelu is also so much more. Even in training, we need two or three players to stop him. He’s a force of nature.” Lukaku has scored 12 goals in 16 Serie A games this term and has helped the Nerazzurri to second after 17 League games. Post Views:
