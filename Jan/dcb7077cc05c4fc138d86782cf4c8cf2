Payne who plays her club football in Spain with Sevilla lasted the duration of the match on her maiden outing, while George replaced Halimatu Ayinde to feature in the final 14 minutes. The Super Falcons will aim to claim top spot when they faced table-toppers Uzbekistan in their second match at the same venue on Saturday. In the other result, Uzbekistan thrashed two-time African champions Equatorial Guinea 5-0 at the same venue on Wednesday evening. Post Views:
