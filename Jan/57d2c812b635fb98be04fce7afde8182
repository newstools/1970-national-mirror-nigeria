The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are overjoyed to be expecting their second child,” a spokesperson for the couple shared.

This comes after Markle disclosed in a New York Times op-ed that she’d miscarried in July of last year. She recalled it being an “unbearable grief” for them to endure. “Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few,” she wrote, adding: “In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.” We’re so excited for the parents-to-be!
