 Former Golden Eaglets forward Taiwo Awoniyi will miss several weeks of action after Union Berlin confirmed his muscle injury. The 23-year-old Liverpool loanee missed the encounter against Freiburg last weekend and medical examinations have now revealed that the Nigerian damaged a muscle in his left thigh. “FC Union Berlin will be without Taiwo Awoniyi for the coming games due to injury,” the club statement read. “After detailed examinations, the Nigerian striker was found to have a muscle injury to his left thigh. Urs Fischer will need to pick his squad without him for the foreseeable future.” Awoniyi has enjoyed a fine run in Urs Fischer’s side this season, scoring five goals in 19 Bundesliga appearances before his latest setback.
