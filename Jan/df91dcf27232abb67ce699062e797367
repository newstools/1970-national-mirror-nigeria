 Barcelona superstar, Lionel Messi has clearly stated that he will prefer to wrestle the Laliga crown away from Real Madrid than win another Pichichi award. The Argentine has won the award for the last two seasons and recently for his 33 goals across the 2019-20 season. “An eighth Pichichi? I don’t know, nor am I thinking about it, it is not something I am worried or obsessed about,” Messi told Marca upon receiving his latest prize. I would prefer to win La Liga before getting the Pichichi, we are fighting towards that. “We are slowly growing. We struggled to get going in the league, nor did we deserve to drop all those points, we could have won several of those games, like at Alaves, Getafe, Real Madrid… “We created a lot of chances, that would have changed the situation, but we have to put together a run of good games to get ourselves back at the top.” Barcelona are currently placed fifth on the log with 21 points, eight points adrift joint leaders Atletico and Real Madrid.
