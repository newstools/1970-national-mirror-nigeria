 Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hailed midfielder Scott McTominay as a ‘physical monster’ after his brace helped the Red Devils to a comprehensive 6-2 victory over Leeds United. The quick-fire double of the Scotland international made history as he became the first player in the league’s history to score twice in the first three minutes of a match. “We’ve been criticised for our starts but the boys were prepared,” Solskjaer told BBC Radio 5 Live. “We’ve approached the game really well. We’ve looked at videos and looked at ways to exploit them but also ways to stop them hurting you. It was a great start. “Scott used to be a striker as a kid – he is a physical monster. He can win in the air, he wins tackles, but he’s so strong and he’s quick as well. He just ran into the space that we hoped he would get and it was good work by the other players to create the space and good finishes. “I have to stop Scott from doing that sometimes – he is an attacking midfielder by nature. But when he sees space in front of him, why stop him? But he’s great at shielding his back four.”
