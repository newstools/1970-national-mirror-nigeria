Reality stars Erica Mena and Safaree Samuels are making a new addition to their family, as they are expecting their second child together. The couple announced on Instagram today (May 3) that they are expecting their second child. Erica Mena and Safaree Samuels have been married since October 2019 and share a one-year-old daughter named Safire. Erica also has another child, a son who is 14 years old, from a previous relationship. The couple announced the big news by way of a maternity photoshoot posted on social media. The shot, which was first posted on Erica’s page, shows the couple standing on stacks of $100 bills, and it was captioned, “More Life??? Who wants that perfect love story anyway.” She is obviously alluding to their dramatic and rocky marriage. Safaree later posted the same image on his Instagram page, along with the caption, “Safire got a new sibling New baby who dis ?? #2under2 time to get neutered now I need a chef and a nanny.” There was a time we thought that the marriage between Safaree Samuels and Erica Mena was over. After all, he told the whole world, via Instagram, that their marriage was over, that he was ending 2020 as a single man and that getting married was the worst decision of his life. This child is the third for Erica Mena, who shares a 14-year-old son with record producer Raul Conde. She has a strict rule about keeping Conde off of social media and away from reality tv.
