 Tottenham take on Brentford in one of the semifinal games of the EFL Cup on Tuesday night and our partners Betpay brings you the preview and betting tips. Tottenham are obvious favourites to progress to the Football League (EFL) Cup final, and put themselves in contention for the club’s first silverware since 2008, when they won the final of this competition. They finished runners up as recently as 2015, but here, they will appreciate that three of their last four EFL Cup ties have gone to a penalty shootout (Pen: W1, L2). One of the shootout defeats detailed above came against lower-league opposition, but in line with projections for Tottenham’s fortunes in this match, every one of Spurs’ last eight regular-time EFL Cup victories over lower-league opponents have seen them score a majority, or all of their goals in the second half. Brentford’s eyes are currently focused on a far greater prize than the EFL Cup, with the ‘Bees’ entering the New Year second in the Championship. That said, they will fight until the bitter end to become the first lower-league side in 30 years to win this competition, the last being the eventually-promoted Sheffield Wednesday team of 1990/91. Since the Football League’s rebrand for 2004/05, Brentford’s only prior regular-time elimination in this competition vs Premier League opponents also came in North London (3-1 vs Arsenal, Sep 2018), though they valiantly drew the second half 1-1. Harder to break down than many expect, Brentford have not conceded a first-half goal at all during this EFL Cup run. Odds Totteham are priced at 1.40 odds for a win while Brentford has high odds of 6.40 odds for the win and a draw attracts odds of 4.15 odds on Betpay. Betting Tip Spurs are odds on favourites for the win and our tipsters say it’s a win for Mourinho’s men and you stake on odds of 1.40 on Betpay. Prediction Tottenham 4-0 Brentford Post Views:
