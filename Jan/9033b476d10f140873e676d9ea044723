 Manchester City have extended a winning run after beating 2-1 West Ham in the Premier League encounter at Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Former Benfica defender Ruben Dias put Manchester City ahead 30th minutes into the encounter to scores his first goal for his new club after Kevin de Bruyne assists West Ham broke Manchester City’s streak of seven consecutive clean sheets at home in all competitions when Michail Antonio scored before the end of the first half. Riyad Mahrez provides the winner after the Algerian winger jinked past West Ham defence just inside the penalty box to set up Dias’ partner John Stone in the 68th minutes. 27 – Man City are unbeaten in their last 27 games in all competitions (W24 D3), the second longest such run in their history (28 games, Apr-Dec 2017). They have now also extended the longest ever winning run by a top-flight side in all comps to 20 matches.
