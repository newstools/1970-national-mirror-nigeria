 Dave Chappelle American stand-up comedian, actor and producer, Dave Chappelle, has disclosed that he wants to feature in a Nollywood movie. He said this during his appearance on the Joe Rogan Podcast. According to him: “I have this weird idea. I want to go to Africa and do some of these Nollywood movies. I’ve been watching them, and how people can solve problems with so little resources. This is what these African directors are like. The movies look crazy but it’s funny how crazy they look. But it is also inspiring because I can’t believe this guy with no resources solve complicated filmmaking problem with this type of ingenuity because they had to. I want just to see what’s popping over there. Africa is popping right now. It’s like something about it makes me feel joyful when I watch it.”
