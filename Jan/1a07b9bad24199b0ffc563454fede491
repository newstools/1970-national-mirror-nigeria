 One of the players many are predicting to have a chance with the Super Eagles next year 2021 is Taiwo Awoniyi and the 23-year old is equally anticipating he would be accorded a chance by the national team handlers soon. Awoniyi has represented Nigeria at youth levels but he is yet to get the chance to play for the senior side. The Liverpool forward presently on loan with Union Berlin has impressed so far in the Bundesliga, with three goals and one assist in 10 league appearances. Awoniyi is keen to maintain the impressive scoring form which he believes will help him gain recognition at the international level.  “The national team question for me is a big thing. I remember in the U17 and U20 days, the pride to wear the national colours is massive,” Awoniyi told Brila FM. “I understand that the country has talents in abundance, But I also have to stick to my principle of time and season and continue to work hard. When it’s my time I’ll take the opportunity and understand it for what it is.”  Recent reports in the media suggest that coach Gernot Rohr is already mulling a possible invitation for Awoniyi having identified the striker as a perfect back up for the injured Victor Osimhen
