 Netflix has renewed Shonda Rhimes’ much-loved series “Bridgerton” for a third and fourth season. This follows the inclusion of four new cast members – Charithra Chandran (Alex Rider), Shelley Conn (Liar), Calam Lynch (Black Beauty), and Rupert Young (Dear Evan Hanson), as well as the announcement that first season lead Rege-Jean Page would not return for the second season. The fictional Lady Whistledown wrote in a note posted on the show’s Instastory, “Esteemed members of the Ton. It seems we have a rather special announcement. Bridgerton shall return for seasons three and four. This author shall have to add more ink.”  Season 2 of the show which is currently in development tells a new romantic tale, that of Lord Anthony Bridgerton’s search for love, in line with the novels on which it is based. Talking about the series Shonda Rhimes says: From the first time I read Julia Quinn’s delicious Bridgerton series, I knew these were stories that would captivate a viewing audience. But the evolution of this adaptation would not be a success without the many significant contributions of the entire Shondaland team. This two-season pickup is a strong vote of confidence in our work and I feel incredibly grateful to have partners as collaborative and creative as Netflix. Betsy and I are thrilled to have the opportunity to continue bringing the world of Bridgerton to a worldwide audience. Photo Credit: bridgertonnetlix
