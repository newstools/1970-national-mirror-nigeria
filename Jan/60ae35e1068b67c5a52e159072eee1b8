FilmmakerÂ Akinola Davies JrÂ has won the Short Film Grand Jury prize at the Sundance Film Festival for his film,Â Lizard. Lizard, a film he co-wrote with his brother, tells the story of an eight-year-old girl, Juwon, who has the ability to sense danger. Until she gets ejected from Sunday school service, she unwittingly witnesses the underbelly in and around a Mega Church in Lagos, Nigeria.  Lizard has made history as the first Nigerian production to win a short film Grand Jury Prize.  Announcing his win on hisÂ Instagram page, Akinola, who is also Screen Internationalâ€™s picks for 2020 Stars of Tomorrow,Â said he is so proud this was made in Lagos by the many hands that make up the beautiful people of Nigeria. He said: Literally a year to this day we started on a project conceived from a bunch of my childhood memories. Today Iâ€™m so grateful to @sundanceorg for awarding LIZARD the the Grand Jury prize for shorts. Iâ€™m overwhelmed and as much as Iâ€™d love to gloat, filmmaking is really crazy hard. Big love to all those who were part of the shorts program â€“ itâ€™s an honour to be amongst such brilliant films. I have to say this award is really for the whole cast and crew who worked so hard and committed their all to this little film pre and during a global pandemic. Iâ€™m so proud this was made in Lagos by the many hands that make up the beautiful people of Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬.
