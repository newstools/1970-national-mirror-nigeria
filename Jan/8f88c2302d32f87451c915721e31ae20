 Crystal Palace are in a less-assured mid-table position compared to the one they occupied at the start of December, after losing four of eight Premier League (PL) games since the November international break (W1, D3). What’s more, they conceded an unanswered average of 2.67 second-half goals per match across the last three defeats therein, while each of their last six league losses actually saw them fail to score. Conversely, each of the Eagles’ last four victories have produced over 2.5 match goals and witnessed both teams score, with Palace consistently opening the scoring inside the first 15 minutes across those. However, Palace are currently on a four-game winless streak at home (D2, L2) and have lost the only prior PL home game this term to see them begin as favourites. Rock-bottom, and on-course to become the first PL club to finish winless and on single digits, Sheffield United (D2, L14) can but continue looking to the club’s situation of 30 years ago for inspiration. Their 17th league game of 1990/91 brought a one-goal margin win (the first league win of that campaign) after a goalless first half. This time around, 11 of their last 13 league defeats have come by that same one-goal margin, implying that a turnaround is close. In a sure sign that their weakness lies within self belief, the decider came beyond the hour mark in six (54.55%) of those 11 losses. Odds
Crystal Palace are priced at 2.10 for a win while a draw gets odds of 3.50. A Sheffield win, however, attracts odds of 3.90. Betting Tip
Sheffield have struggled all season and remain rooted to the bottom of the league and bookies believe it will be yet another defeat or a draw for them and Betpay has odds of  1.22  for that eventuality. Prediction
Crystal Palace 2-1 Sheffield
