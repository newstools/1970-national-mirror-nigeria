 Erstwhile Super Eagles winger, Emmanuel Amunike has called for caution among Barca chieftains as curtains draw on Lionel Messi’ reign at the Catalan side. The former Barcelona winger urged the club to respect Messi’s decision on his future when his contract ends this summer.  “You never know what’s going to happen,” Amuneke told Radio MARCA. “The reality is that you have to thank Messi for everything he’s given to Barcelona. But everything has its beginning and end. He’s not as young as he was. “But I’ll remember what Messi has done for the club. If Messi leaves, you have to respect him and thank him for what he’s done,” he told Marca. Amuneke who joined Barcelona after the current boss, Ronald Koeman, had left the club rallied behind the Dutch manager, adding that the club yearning for a major trophy this season is just one match away.  He stated in clear terms that Barcelona qualifications for Supercopa de Espana will help improve the fortune of the team and boost players’ confidence in Laliga “I’m happy for Koeman,” the Nigerian added. “It hasn’t been so easy for him. “Now they’re in the final of the Supercopa de Espana and that will give the team more confidence,” he concluded.
