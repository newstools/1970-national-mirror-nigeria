 Kano Pillars failed to earn a share of the spoils in Sunday’s titanic NPFL clash away to Enyimba; losing 2-1 to the People’s Elephant in Aba. Sai Masu Gida were unbeaten going into the matchday 5 tie but their impressive run was halted as Enyimba prevailed in what some call the ‘Nigerian Clasico’ First-half goals from Anayo Iwuala in the  21st minute and another from Gabriel Orok in the 38th minute sealed victory for Fatai Osho’s men even though Fahad Usman scored a sumptuous free-kick for Pillars in the 86th minute. Enyimba now have three wins in three home games this season and already breathing down the neck of table-toppers Rivers United who in their own game thumped Heartland 3-1 at the Adokiye Amaesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt. Goals from Aguda Godwin in the first half and the duo of Enyinnaya Kazie and  Malachi Ohawuma in the second half ensured victory for Stanley Eguma’s men on Sunday.  Away Points There were away points for Rangers International, Abia Warriors and Kwara United in Sunday’s matches. While the Flying Antelopes and Abia Warriors recorded identical 1-1 draws against MFM FC and FCIU respectively, Kwara United played a barren draw against Jigawa Golden Stars. Meanwhile, a late goal in Markudi ended the unbeaten run of Dakkada FC as Lobi Stars pipped the Akwa Ibom team 2-1. Samuel Mathias had given Lobi Stars the lead in the 17th minute but Christian Ekong pulled level for Dakkada in the 71st minute. The visitors were however denied a share of the spoils in Markurdi when a late penalty kick was awarded against them and was expertly dispatched by Austin Onye in stoppage time.  Biggest win However, the biggest win of the weekend was recorded in Jos where Plateau United secured an emphatic 3-0 victory over Adamawa United. A brace from Innocent Kingsley after Amos Gyan had scored the opening goal gave the peace victory that has seen them climb up to the ninth spot on the NPFL log.
