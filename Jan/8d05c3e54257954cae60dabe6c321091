 Bayern Munich has joined Barcelona in the race to sign Liverpool star Gini Wijnaldum this summer. Barcelona has been credited with interest for the Dutch international for some time, with a move to Camp Nou for the former Newcastle United star was on the brink of happening in the last summer transfer market.  German Champions Bayern Munich has now joined the race to snap up the midfielder on a free transfer as the player confirmed that he is seeking a ‘new adventure’ after five years at Anfield which has intensified the effort of Barcelona and Bayern Munich to vie for his signature this summer, the fact that he is available for free also interest both clubs involved in his services. If Barcelona manager Ronald Koeman remains at the Camp Nou, the Spanish giant might have an edge over Bayern Munich, considering that Koeman and Wijnaldum worked together in the Netherlands national team prior to the former’s appointment at Camp Nou. Bayern Munich could be forced to look elsewhere if the Dutch star joins Barcelona this summer. Post Views:
