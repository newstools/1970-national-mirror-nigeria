Style influencer and designer Sade Akinosho is easily one of the most stylish influencers on the g’ram. The fashionista has a very distinct sense of style that is unique to her, so much so that you can tell an outfit put together by Sade without having to see her face. We are inclined to believe that her style game is innate because of how well she slays vibrant and neutral fits effortlessly, as well as her ability to switch from a three-piece suit to a flowy summer dress with so much ease and still look every bit as fashionable both ways.
