 The Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has reacted after a leaked memo from the ministry made its way on social media. The ministry described the leaked memo as original and explained that it built the mosque for livestock farmers. Director of Information, for the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development FMARD, Theodore Ogaziechi, released a statement about the memo as she described that the livestock farmers were sacked from their settlements by Boko Haram insurgents in Borno so they had to build a mosque for them. It said, “To put the facts straight, the memo is authentic and appropriate in all ramifications. “It is original and was issued by the ministry for the construction of a worship centre for a community of livestock farmers who were sacked and displaced in Borno State by Boko Haram insurgents and are being resettled in Ngarannam/Mafa Local Government, Borno State.” “The construction of the mosque was a special request from the community through the Borno State Government to avoid moving too far from the settlement areas for prayers and also to ensure their safety and contact with the insurgents,” It added, “The memo is an official document and it is available for public scrutiny and review. It is therefore unfortunate for anyone to presume that the memo leaked. “The ministry is in no way perturbed about the matter because it received appropriate approval, carried out due needs assessment, and ensured due process in the execution of the project.”
