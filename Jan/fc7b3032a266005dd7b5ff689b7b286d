After trending on Twitter for his new single, “Thunder Fire You”, Ric Hassani stated on Saturday that the track got banned by the National Broadcasting Commission (NBC), and radio stations are being fined for playing it. The track which is off his recently released album, “The Prince I Became”, sees the singer berating his ex lover after ditching him despite all his sacrifices. “The love I gave you, was too perfect for you. And you know I tried to make your dreams come true. And you knew this you still went and threw this, threw this away (away). It’s okay,” the lyrics read. Sharing the information on his Twitter page, he tweeted, “So, the NBC has banned my song ‘Thunder Fire You’ and are fining radio stations that play it. Interesting”. So, the NBC has banned my song ‘Thunder Fire You’ and are fining radio stations that play it. Interesting. — Ric Hassani (@RicHassani) February 26, 2021 The commission is yet to give details on the circumstances that led to the ban. However, fans of Ric Hassani, and those who love the track, have taken to Twitter reacting to the news of the ban. This is what people are saying in the streets of Twitter: I didn't know about "Thunder Fire You" until now. Banning the song prompted me to streaming it!! NBC thanks for promoting Ric — Tilewa (@Tilewaolami) February 27, 2021 The song promotes our culture. “Thunder fire you” is a Nigerian staple. Not once in my life did I see or hear Thunder fire anybody after those words were uttered, so you can’t say the song promotes violence. If can’t make songs that reflect what we say in real life, then WTF? — Baba Anino (@olaDEL) February 27, 2021 So NBC didn't see any reason to ban "Cash app" but they banned "thunder fire you" 🤔 — Cinderella Man🦅 (@abdumillz) February 27, 2021 They banned Ric Hassani's Thunder Fire You because they don't want it to be the theme song for next protest.
