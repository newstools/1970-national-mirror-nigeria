 Mikel Obi was missing as Stoke City lost 3-1 to Tottenham Hotspur in the quarter-final of the Carabao Cup played at the Bet-365 stadium on Wednesday and missed the opportunity of  reunion with former manager Jose Mourinho. Despite returning to training last week, the Nigerian was not part of Michael O’Neill side that was thrashed by the North London outfit under the tutulege of Jose Mourinho. Speaking after the encounter, said: “We knew Spurs would come with a strong team. We are a Championship side at this minute in time, and so have players who have never played against the likes of Bale, Kane, Son, Moura, Dele Alli. That’s an indication of the quality of the opposition. “At 1-1, I felt there was going to be something here for us, but for their second goal we don’t clear the ball and it’s a great finish. And then for the third one we give the ball away in a poor area and Harry Kane punishes us.” Jordan Thompson canceled out Gareth Bale’s opener for Spurs but the visitors showed real class in the second half and two more goals from Ben Davies and Harry Kane ensure that the London side progressed into the semifinal of the competition.
