 Barcelona FC Star Antoine Griezmann became father for the third time on Thursday morning when his wife Erika Choperena gave birth to Alba. Curiously, all their children were born on April 8, with Mia coming first in 2016 and Amaro being born three years later the same day. “Today marks two and five years since you arrived,” wrote Choperena on social media to wish her kids happy birthday. “You revolutionised our world and made us grow, learn and be better. “Mum and dad can’t be prouder of what you have made us build. We love you infinitely, crazily and freely.”
