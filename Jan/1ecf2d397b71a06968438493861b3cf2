 Parents of kidnapped students of Greenfield University have been contacted requesting fresh demands to secure the release their wards. Abductors had first asked of N800 million as ransom however the failure of their families and government to meet their demands led to the death of five students in the first week. Last week Monday, the big brain behind the kidnap, Sani Idris Jalingo, aka Baleri requested N100 million and 10 motorcycles after giving an ultimatum to take the lives of the remaining students if they refuse to honour their demands another time. It seems they backed down on their quest to kill the remaining students if the ransom was not paid. They have however resorted to reaching out to the families of the students individually on Monday, May 10. They asked each parent to pay N10 million for their wards. A family member of one of the victims said; “They called us today (Monday) and told me that if I pay N10 million today, my sister will be released today.”
