 Nigerian rapper Ajebutter has shared his mom’s reaction for being a groomsman once again making it the uncountable time of being a groomsman. Ajebutter shared how shuttered his mom was upon seeing a photo of him being a groomsman at a friend or close pal’s wedding again as it appears he has become the option for everyone in his circle when it comes to groomsmen. His mother said he’s becoming a professional groomsman that means he has become the hope of every groom in his circle that they will always call on him to be part of their bridal team always.
