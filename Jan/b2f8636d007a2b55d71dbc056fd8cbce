 A federal high court in Apo, Abuja, has ordered that fresh court processes be served on Femi Fani-Kayode, a former aviation minister, with respect to a suit filed by Precious Chikwendu, his estranged wife. Chikwendu had instituted the suit marked CV/372/2021, seeking custody of her four sons – Aragorn, Ragnar, Aiden and Liam. The mother of four is praying the court to direct the former minister, who is the sole respondent in the matter, to pay the sum of N3.438 million monthly towards the maintenance and upkeep of the four children, “with the possibility of a review of the sum every two years upon an application to the court”. At the last adjourned date, Sylvester Oriji, the judge, had ordered that hearing notice should be served on the respondent. However, at the court session on Friday, Adeola Adedipe, Fani-Kayode’s lawyer, said his client never received court processes, and that his purported signature acknowledging service was forged. He said the only reason the minister was present in court was out of protest, and not because he received the notice. Adedipe prayed the court to decline jurisdiction in hearing the matter, or in the alternative, set aside the earlier purported service of the processes filed by the plaintiff on his client.
