 Cristiano Ronaldo is a five-time Ballon D’Or winner but that didn’t faze Everton assistant coach Davide Ancelotti who compared club tailsman Dominic Calvert-Lewin to the Juventus striker. Ronaldo has 16 goals in 14 appearances in all competitions with Juventus while English forward has 14 goals in 16 appearances with the Toffees this season. “He is a special player,” Carlo Ancelotti’s son toldTalkSport. “Game-by-game you can see his improvement and how he is able to make the difference in this league. It’s not easy to make the difference. “Especially from a physical point of view, it’s difficult to see a player in this league that is better than the others because the level is really high. “Of course, he is at the beginning of his way. But as I said, game-by-game, I’m seeing big improvements. Also in training he is working very hard to improve. “The special ability he has, that all the big talents have, is that he knows his body really well. He knows his feelings really well and that’s not so common. For example, [Cristiano] Ronaldo was a player like this. He was able to understand his body.”
