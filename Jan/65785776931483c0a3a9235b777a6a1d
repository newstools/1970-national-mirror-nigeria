 Ex-BBNaija reality star Rebecca Nengi Hampson has finally ticked getting a new house off her checklist. Nengi shared photos of her lovely â€˜Pengiâ€™ home and captioning it, she wrote: 2021 just keeps getting better. With consistency, dedication, and hard work, I finally get to tick this off my checklist. Thank you, Lord, for your continued blessings. Canâ€™t wait to play table tennis with my friends in my â€˜Pengiâ€™ home ðŸ˜„  Congratulations Nengi! Photo Credit: @nengiofficial
