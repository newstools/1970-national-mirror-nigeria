 Super Eagles forward, Paul Onuachu continued his blistering form this season as he grabbed a hat-trick in Genkâ€™s 4-1 victory over Eupen during the Belgium Jupiler League match played on Wednesday night. The gangling 26-year-old, who has enjoyed a great season so far was once again trusted by manager John van den Brom to lead the line while compatriot Cyriel Dessers was on the bench. Genk wasted no time with an early goal when Junya Ito stabbed home a pass from Bastien Toma to make it 1-0. Stef Peeters equalized for the home side but Onuachu ensured that the away side went into the break with the lead as he put them 2-1 ahead. The second half was relatively easy for Genk as Onuachu scored two penalties to complete his hat-trick and hand his side a comprehensive 4-1 away win. And took his goals tally in the league to 16 in 18 appearances. Genk remain second on the log with 38 points while Eupen sit 15th with 20 points and a game in hand. Post Views:
