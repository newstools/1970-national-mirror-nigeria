 The management of Greenfield University has confirmed the release of all students and non-academic staff abducted by bandits. In April, armed bandits attacked the institution abducting 20 students and three non-academic staff of the university in Kaduna. However, the bandits killed five students and a male warden while in their captivity. On Saturday, the remaining fourteen abducted students of the university regained their freedom. According to the parents, the sum of N180 million was paid to bandits before their children were released.
