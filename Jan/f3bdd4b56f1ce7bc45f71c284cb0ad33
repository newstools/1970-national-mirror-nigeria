 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has arrested a former Imo State governor, Senator Rochas Okorocha. According to reports, the senator was arrested around 4 pm on April 13, and he was arrested at his Unity House private office in Abuja. Senator Okorocha was arrested after a five-hour confrontation with EFCC operatives and it comes after he had reportedly refused to honour several invitations from the agency. It was also revealed in the report that his arrest is connected to an alleged monumental graft during his eight-year reign as governor. The arrest was confirmed by the spokesperson of the EFCC, Wilson Uwujaren to Vanguard newspaper. Confirming the arrest, he said; “Okorocha has been arrested by our men.” We are working around the clock to bring our readers more updates from this development. Meanwhile, the former governor has reacted to the recent attack on the state police headquarters and the correctional centres. He made this submission in Jos and according to him, the recent attack on the police headquarters, the Correctional Centres in Imo State, and others including the unending herdsmen crisis, banditry, Boko Haram and all the abductions are all the results of poverty and injustice. In his view, now is the time for political leaders to tell themselves the truth and address these situations in order to help men and women of the Armed Forces and the police who are currently at the battlefront with the symptoms and not the disease. In his submission, he said; “The recent attack on the police headquarters, the Correctional Centres in Imo State, the unending herdsmen crisis and banditry, Boko Haram, kidnappings, these are all products of poverty and injustice. Time has come for we as political leaders to tell ourselves the truth and address this ugly situation and help our men and women of the Armed Forces and the police who are currently fighting the symptoms and not the disease. Something must be done urgently too.”
