In the end, it was Omoyele who showed his predatory skills with a double strike in the first half to help the Aba Millionaire side with a comfortable win. The former Osun United bundled in the opener in the 27th minute before doubling the advantage with a sumptuous strike moments after, Omoyele’s striker caught Plateau United goalkeeper Chinedu Anozie napping. A tactical second half from the Abdul Maikaba tutored side, saw them gain some sort of foothold in the game, and were rewarded with a consolatory goal from Moses Effiong, who gets his head on the free-kick of Ndala and directs it past John Noble in the 76th minute. Enyimba remain top with Saturday’s win Post Views:
