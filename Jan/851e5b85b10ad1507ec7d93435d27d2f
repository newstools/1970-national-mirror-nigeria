 Manchester United play their game in hand when they visit Burnley on Tuesday with a chance of going three points clear at the top of the table and our partners Betpay gives you a preview and betting tips. Burnley look to continue their push away from the relegation zone with a third consecutive Premier League (PL) home victory for the first time since 2016/17. In pursuit of a first PL win at home to Manchester United in six attempts (D1, L4), Burnley haven’t even managed to score in any of those five winless outings, but conceding two goals or less in each of the four defeats. Their current unbeaten PL run at home includes their only win from five attempts as a home outsider (D1, L3), with the remaining results encompassing their four home encounters with clubs to start the round in the top-half of the PL table. Concerningly, Burnley failed to score in all three defeats. Manchester United’s best season in terms of points gained at this stage since finishing second in 2017/18 includes the PL’s only unbeaten away record (W6, D1), with the Red Devils now having taken points from their last 14 PL away trips (W11, D3). Their average of three goals per away game is the best of any PL team for either a home or a travelling campaign (at the beginning of the round). An impressive two-thirds of those goals have been recorded after HT, ensuring they retain a perfect away PL record (W6) when conceding first, and even a perfect away record (W2) when trailing at HT on the road. Odds Betpay has Burnley for a win at 6.45 odds and a Manchester United for 1.50 while pricing a draw at 4.60. Betting Tips The Red Devils are in form and know that a win here takes them above Liverpool on the table ahead of the trip to Anfield and won’t be short of motivation but they come up against a stubborn Burnley side. However, our tipsters have United for the win and you can head over to Betpay to stake on odds of 1.50. Prediction Burnley 1-3 Manchester United Post Views:
