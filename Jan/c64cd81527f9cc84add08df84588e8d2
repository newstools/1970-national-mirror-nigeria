 Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp snubbed three African superstars of Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang after he named Robert Lewandowski the best player he ever managed. The 53-year-old German coach manages Salah, Mane at Liverpool, while Arsenal and Gabon skipper with the Reds boss during his spell at Borussia Dortmund. Klopp spent seven at Signal Iduna Park where he coaches the current world football of the year, Lewandowski as both pair won consecutive Bundesliga titles, DFB-Pokal and DFL-Supercup and also reached the Champions League final before losing league rival Bayern Munich.  Liverpool manager was asked to name the best player he’s ever coached but the German left out three African superstars of Salah, Mane and Aubameyang plus Netherland defender Virgil van Dijk. Klopp told Bild: “Robert Lewandowski. It actually won’t be fair to say that about any other player except Lewy. “What he has made out of his potential, how he pushed himself to become the player he is today, that’s extraordinary.” He added: “Lewy took every step he needed to take to be that goal machine. Every one. “He has immersed himself in the game, he just knows in every situation what he has to do, where he has to go. Lewy is an absolute machine.” Lewandowski eventually left BVB for Bayern in 2014 and his career has gone from strength to strength with the 32-year-old winning the Bundesliga a further six times as well as the Champions League last season.
