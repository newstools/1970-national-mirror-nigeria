 Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel wants Bayern Munich defender Niklas Sule at the Stamford Bridge season. Tuchel wants to improve the Chelsea team that lost the FA Cup final against Leicester City as he makes huge plans for next season. Chelsea is prepared to meet Bayern Munichâ€™s requirement to part ways with the Germany international who has just a year left in his deal with the Bundesliga Champions. Bayern Munich has already released David Alaba on a free transfer to Real Madrid and they have bought in Dayot Upamecano and could listen to offers for Sule during the summer. Sule,25, remains a prime target for Tuchel and the German tactician is willing to add more depth to the squad that has the likes of Kourt Zuma, Antonio Rudiger, Christensen and Thiago Silva. Tuchel is willing to make Chelsea a force to reckon with in the Premier League and in Europe as he is prepared to vie for the domestic league and the Champions League, he has already qualified the team to the Champions League final after eliminating Real Madrid in the semifinals. Chelsea is also in the race to sign another Bayern Munich ace Robert Lewandowski when the summer transfer windows open. Post Views:
