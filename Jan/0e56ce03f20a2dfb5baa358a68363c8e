 Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has revealed that he will implement a different training regime in preparation for their crunch clash with Manchester United. The biggest game of the Premier League season so far takes place next week when the Reds welcome bitter rivals United to Anfield in a top of the table clash. Liverpool have already got their fixture out of the way for this weekend, beating a very young Aston Villa side 4-1 in the FA Cup third round. And ahead of next weekend’s game, which Klopp has nine days to prepare for, the German has admitted that is going to shake things up to keep his players as fresh as possible. “Exactly and that’s what we will do,” Klopp told BT Sport when asked about the lengthy lay off. “Very important. We have a lot players with no rhythm. “So, we will do a lot of 11 v 11 situations [in training] because that’s a very important thing for football players that we couldn’t give them too often. “Now we have the time and will use it for that yes.” Liverpool were expected to come through their clash with Villa comfortably, given the hosts were without their entire first team squad and staff. But they went in at half time drawing 1-1 at Villa Park, and Klopp could not deny that the home side’s youngsters put up an excellent fight against the strong team he put out. He added: “Yeah bit more of a challenge than it should have been but first and foremost we have to say that the kids did really well – that’s good. We scored a nice goal from that moment on. “Didn’t pass with the right speed. We had football problems. We saw in the second half that the football problems were football. It’s good. We needed a little bit longer but then it was completely clear. Completely comfortable and like it should have been” Post Views:
