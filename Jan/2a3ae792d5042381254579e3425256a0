 Super Eagles wing-back Ola Aina continued his good form for Fulham as they battled to a goalless draw against in-form Southampton in a premier league match. The defender who is currently on loan from Serie A side Torino was rated 7.5 alongside Kyle Walker-Peters by popular English website Dailymail following his outstanding display against the Saints. Former Arsenal winger Theo Walcott who saw a goal ruled out for offside was rated 6.5 while James Ward-Prowse got 7.0. Aina’s teammate Ademola Lookman also got a 7.5 rating but it was the former Chelsea lad that was named Man of the Match for Dailymail. Stuart Gray stood-in for Fulham manager at the post match interview told reporters: “We’re a little disappointed,” Gray admitted. “You can tell by their reaction that they were happy to get the point. We got into some very good areas. The final ball let us down at times but that’s now four games unbeaten in the Premier League which is very difficult to do.”  “We’re playing against a very good side today in what they do. The pressure and closure they bring, we worked on it all week, and we knew five or six would come to close down. Credit to our boys for being brave on the ball and we worked the ball into good areas. The final piece of the jigsaw is to put the ball in the net. I’m a glass-half-full guy, and four games unbeaten compared to the start of the season says we’re going in the right direction.” The second stalemate in as many games at Craven Cottage meant that Scott Parker’s side haven’t conceded from open play in the previous four thanks to solid performances from the likes of Ola Aina.
