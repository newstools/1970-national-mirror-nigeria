 American Singer, Ariana Grande shares stunning from her intimate wedding with California realtor, Dalton Gomez. The 27-year-old singer took to Instagram on Wednesday to share a series of breathtaking photos from her wedding day with Dalton Gomez, marking the first pics we’ve seen from their private nuptials. The two tied the knot in an intimate, informal ceremony held at the singer’s home in Montecito, California, on May 15. The photos showcase Grande’s gorgeous wedding day look, which consisted of a custom lily-white silk charmeuse empire waist column gown by Vera Wang, accented with a sculpted neckline, an exposed bra strap closure and a plunging back. Grande completed the timeless ensemble with pearl and diamond earrings by Lorraine Schwartz (that matched her engagement ring!) and a hand-pleated bubble veil topped with a satin bow. See photos
