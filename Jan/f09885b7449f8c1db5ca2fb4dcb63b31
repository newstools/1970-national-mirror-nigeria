 Boss Mustapha The Federal government has taken delivery of 100,000 doses of Covishield vaccines donated by the Government of India to Nigeria. Boss Mustapha, Chairman of the Presidential Taskforce on COVID19, interacted with reporters in Abuja on Tuesday where he disclosed that the government was looking forward to receiving more vaccines from the African Union’s Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT). He said: “As you are aware, Nigeria received 3.94 million doses of the COVID-19 Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine on March 2, 2021. These vaccines represented the first tranche of about 16 million doses allocated to Nigeria through the COVAX facility, aimed at vaccinating an initial 20 per cent of the population. More vaccines are also expected from the African Union’s Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT). We shall also be receiving about 100,000 doses of Covishield vaccines donated by the Government of India to Nigeria. This will further boost the number of Nigerians to be vaccinated by about 50,000. The PTF through the Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) and the National Primary Health Center Development Agency (NPHCDA) prioritised the initial consignment of vaccines to cover frontline medical personnel, strategic leadership, and those above the age of 50 years across the nation. Majority of sub-national entities have already received their allocation and administration is progressing. As at April 5, 2021, 963,802 persons in Nigeria had received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. The overarching objective is to vaccinate 70 per cent of Nigeria’s population between 2021 and 2022.”
