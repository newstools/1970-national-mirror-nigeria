 Nasir Elrufai Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State has opened up about how he was deserted by his wives when he was diagnosed with Coronavirus. According to him, he contracted the dreaded COVID-19 from a fellow governor in 2020 and brought it to Kaduna State where he ended up being locked up in solitary confinement for 26 days. He noted that his wives even deserted him in the condition and left him to his fate. The governor spoke at the seventh Ahmadu Bello Foundation lecture in Kaduna on a lecture dubbed ‘COVID-19: Way forward for Northern Nigeria economy,’ where he recounted his battle with Covid-19. In his words: “A governor infected me with COVID-19 virus and I brought it to Kaduna. I was locked up for 26 days. My wives ran away from me. Fifty thousand people in Kaduna would have died of COVID-19 last year, but for the fact that Kaduna State was the first to lock down. “I am happy to say because of COVID-19, we have been able to put in place infectious disease wards in our hospitals. People travel around the world so there may be ‘COVID-25’ or 30. With what is happening in India, the situation is scary. But God has been very kind to us.” Recall the Covid 19 outbreak left a very bitter memory in the minds of Nigerians as many people lost their loved ones and family.
