 Semi Ajayi has earned praise from teammate Matt Phillips from his goalscoring performance against premier league champions Liverpool as he helped West Brom to a hard fought 1-1 draw at Anfield. The Super Eagles defender has been a mainstay in the Baggies line-up from last season and showed no fear while facing the deadly trio of Robert Firmino, Saido Mane and Mohamed Salah – the Red machines that scored seven past Crystal Palace the previous week. The goal was Ajayi’s first in the 2020/2021 premier league season and his West Brom teammate Matt Phillips said after the encounter: “We had a game plan and we stuck to it. They are the champions for a reason and they play some great football but we stayed in the game after going one down and Semi [Ajayi] popped up with a great header. “When you come to the big sides you have to work hard first and foremost and we got our rewards. We frustrated them and we only needed one chance to get something from the game. It was a great header and i thought Semi’s overall performance was excellent.” It wasn’t an easy game for the visitors as they went behind in the first half when Joel Matip’s long pass was controlled beautifully by Mane before firing past Sam Johnstone. Interestingly, Sam Allardyce was the last visiting manager to pick a win at Anfield against Liverpool and that was achieved on April 23, 2017 – exactly 1,344 days – three years – eight months – and 66 matches before Sunday’s encounter. Allardyce did not quite repeat the feat but had Ajayi’s late bullet header to thank for escaping defeat.
