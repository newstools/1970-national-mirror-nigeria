 Despite Wednesday’s 4-0 win over Strasbourg in the Ligue 1, multiple reports indicate that Thomas Tuchel has lost his job as PSG manager. The 47-year old manager has been sacked two-and-a-half years into his reign having begun his spell with the Parisians in June 2018. Tuchel’s contract was set to expire at the end of this season but the PSG top guns seem to have run out of patience and lost confidence in the former Borussia Dortmund gaffer.  Tuchel joined the Parisian club in May 2018 on an initial two-year contract after replacing Spaniard Unai Emery, agreeing to a one-year extension in May 2019. Former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino has been linked regularly with the PSG job in recent months. The 48-year-old Argentine, who played for PSG between 2001 and 2003, has been without a job since leaving Spurs in November 2019. Apart from Pochettino, former Juventus coach, Massimiliano Allegri is also seen as another possible replacement for Tuchel at PSG.
