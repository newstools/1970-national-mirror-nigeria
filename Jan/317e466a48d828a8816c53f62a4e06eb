 Real Madrid president Florentino Perez has hit out at UEFA counterpart Aleksander Ceferin. Perez the initiator of the European Super League was on the Spanish television programme El Chiringuito to talk about the breakaway venture he is leading, and he called out Ceferin’s language. “What the president of UEFA cannot do is insult people, like he insulted [Juventus president Andrea] Agnelli,” said Perez. “I think it is disgraceful. UEFA needs to change, we don’t want a president who insults, and we want transparency. “We all change, and we change for the better.” The Real Madrid chief’s comments relate to Ceferin claiming that Agnelli lied to him about the potential European Super League. Perez wasn’t holding back and his criticism went beyond football. “This is inconceivable in a democratic Europe, you don’t say these things, for the good of society,” said Perez. Post Views:
