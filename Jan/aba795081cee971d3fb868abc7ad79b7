 Thomas Tuchel is facing a midfield problem as the Chelsea squad revealed for the second leg of the last 16 UEFA Champions League clash with Atletico Madrid at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. The Blues, who extended their unbeaten start to life under head coach Tuchel to 12 matches on Saturday, playing out a goalless stalemate with Leeds United at Elland Road, hold a one-goal advantage from the first-leg in Bucharest last month courtesy of Olivier Giroudâ€™s second-half overhead-kick. Tuchelâ€™s unbeaten start to life in London is also at stake this week with former Borussia Dortmund coach boss with his two midfielders of Mason Mount and Jorginho as both pair have been ruled out of the last-16 second-leg tie against Atletico Madrid suspension.  However, Brazilain defender Thiago Silva and Nigerian descent Tammy Abraham have not recovered full yet from various injuries.
