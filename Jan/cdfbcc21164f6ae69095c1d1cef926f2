 Aston Villa reacted after the son of former Super Eagles right-back Jero Shakpoke has reacted after signing his first professional contract. The 17-year-old Ruben joined Aston Villa on a scholarship contract last October from Norwich but the deal has been upgraded to a professional contract.  Ruben Academy Manager Mark Harrison told the club official website where he said: “We are delighted Ruben has signed his first professional contract with us. “His game time has been hampered by injury but once he his back fully fit we look forward to him fulfilling his potential, which is very clear to see.” Ruben has a famous dad Jero Shakpoke who was the Super Eagles’ first-choice right-back in the build-up to the 1998 FIFA World Cup, only for him to pick up a long-term injury against Holland before the start of the tournament in France. Ruben has made two appearances for Aston Villa in the U18 Premier League, against Tottenham Hotspur and Fulham. Post Views:
