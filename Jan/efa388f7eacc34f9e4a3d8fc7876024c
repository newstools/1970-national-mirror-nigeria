 Senior Pastor of the House on the Rock Church Lagos, Pastor Paul Adefarasin, has sounded a word of caution to his church members to get a plan B by planning their escape route out of the country in the face of constant insecurity. According to the man of God, his members need to hatch a plan B to survive as his wife is currently out of Nigeria helping to create their own plan B. He lamented about how bad the insecurity has gotten to that requires that people need to get a backup plan. ‘He said: ‘No country in the world history has survived two civil wars. You could be in fright and running for your dear life anyday from now if this thing does not come to an end. My personal encouragement to leaders and government on all sides is that it is not time to be partisan, blend the aisles. It is time to sit down and dialogue.” ”I bring you greeetings from Pastor Ifeanyi who is busy taking care of the frontier of our world and preparing our escape root. If you don’t have a plan B. …I know you have faith, but I have faith too but I have a plan B.
With technology I can speak to you from anywhere in the world. Get yourself a plan B. Wether that’s an Okada to Cameroon or flying boat or speed boat as we call them to Seme Border or a holein the ground, get your plan B because these people are crazy. They ate nutters. The whole bunch of them. And watch the signs because it can happen like this. God forbid!”
