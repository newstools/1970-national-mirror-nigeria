 Garba Shehu Reacts To Reno Omokri’s Challenge Former presidential aide under Goodluck Jonathan’s led administration, Reno Omokri on Wednesday challenged Buhari’s presidential spokesman, Garba Shehu to spend a night in Koshebe Borno State or Kware in Sokoto State without security and receive a monetary gift of $20,000 from him. Reno had made the challenge following a statement by Garba Shehu that President Muhammadu Buhari had made Nigeria safer than it was before. Garba Shehu said General @MBuhari has made Nigeria safer. I vow to pay @GarShehu $20000 if he will spend a night without security in Koshobe, or Kware, verified by an independent journalist. I will give the funds to @DeleMomodu when Garba accepts to go Retweet so Garba sees this — Reno Omokri (@renoomokri) December 23, 2020 Responding to Reno’s challenge, Garba Shehu rejected it, saying “If this is the money from the collections made in the name of Leah Sharibu, the unfortunate Christian girl stolen by Boko Haram, I won’t touch it with a long. Please keep “your USD20000”. If this is the money from the collections made in the name of Leah Sharibu, the unfortunate Christian girl stolen by Boko Haram, I won’t touch it with a long.
