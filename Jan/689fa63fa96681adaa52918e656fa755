 Ivory Coast defender Eric Bailey has given an injury update after he was stretched off during Manchester United’s 1-0 win over Watford in the third round of the FA Cup. Scott McTominay scored the only goal for the Red Devils but the biggest worry for the home side was when Bailey was clattered into by Dean Henderson and was replaced by Harry Maguire at half-time. Bailey wrote on his official Instagram page after the encounter: ‘Good job by the team to advance in the #FACup. I am OK, it was just a knock.’ The latest update from the player who has been plagued by injurues since last season will be a welcome relief to manager Ole Gunner Solskjaer after he returned to the premier league joint leaders in good form.
