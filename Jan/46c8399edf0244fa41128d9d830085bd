Eku Edewor celebrated her recent birthday in glamorous style. The actress has presented several stellar looks in the past, but on this occasion she was in rare form . In this case she was serving up a different silhouette from Nigerian designer Lisa Folawiyo Studio, one of our favourites from the designers latest collection for the instant impact it makes. Predictably artistic, featuring a single diamante fringe that shows up beautifully when the wearer is in motion, the high neck and mini hemline gave it a sleek, sophisticated edge while the contrasting colour palette in the stunning prints  Lisa Folawiyo is known for, provide the brand’s signature dramatic finishing touches and has a very fresh, youthful feel. For accessories, she opted for simple earrings and silver strappy heels. A sleek ponytail and arresting eye makeup completed this irresistible look. We definitely think BellaStylistas will be inspired by looks like this one in 2021-  appropriate for intimate gatherings as well as celebratory photo shoots ( and if they aren’t, they really should be!)
