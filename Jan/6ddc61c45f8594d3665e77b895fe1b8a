 Best FIFA Men’s Player for 2020, Robert Lewandowski has revealed that former club Borussia Dortmund stopped him from joining Manchester United during the 2012 season. The Poland captain explained that he was willing to switch clubs and move to England after having good conversations with the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson. Lewandowski spent four trophy-laden seasons at Dortmund before joining Bayern Munich on a free transfer in 2014. “After my second year in Dortmund, I had a conversation with Sir Alex Ferguson,” Lewandowski told France Football. “He wanted me to come to Manchester. I was very interested. I can even say I was ready. But Dortmund didn’t want to let me go. It didn’t upset me more than that because things were going well with Borussia.” Lewandowski also talked about his love for Arsenal great Thierry Henry when he was a youngster. “The ones I admired were Alessandro Del Piero and Thierry Henry, even Roberto Baggio, whom I saw playing when I was very young,” he said. “But, as much as the big names, what made me dream were the big stadiums and their atmospheres.”
