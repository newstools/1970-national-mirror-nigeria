Before we go, this month of March, we are celebrating International Women’s Month by spotlighting the influential women of Africa. Specifically, we want to celebrate those women who have been instrumental to the promotion of unity, justice and the fight against prejudice, featuring a series of Afri Docs documentaries. This week’s feature is the 2017 documentary titled “Mama Colonel“, directed by Dieudo Hamadi. Mama Colonel (French: Maman Colonelle) is a documentary film based in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The film focuses on the work of Colonel Honorine Munyole who fights against sexual abuse and child abuse.

Having worked for 15 years in Bukavu, in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she learns she is transferred to Kisangani. There, she finds herself faced with new challenges.
