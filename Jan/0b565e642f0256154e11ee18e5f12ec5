Billionaire Bill Gates and his wife Melinda Gates have decided to put an end to their 27 years of married life and are getting a divorce. This comes after they spent the last twenty-seven years together as husband and wife. This was made known by the Microsoft Co-founder in a recent post on social media. According to him, the decision came after a great deal of thought and also a lot of work on their relationship. He stated that although they won’t be together as a couple, they will still continue to work together at their foundation adding their family needs privacy in this stage in their new life. The statement reads; “After a great deal of thought and a lot of work on our relationship, we have made the decision to end our marriage. Over the last 27 years, we have raised three incredible children and built a foundation that works all over the world to enable all people to lead healthy, productive lives. We continue to share a belief in that mission and will continue to work together at the foundation, but we no longer believe we can grow together as a couple in this next phase of our lives. We ask for space and privacy for our family as we begin to navigate this new life.” pic.twitter.com/padmHSgWGc — Bill Gates (@BillGates) May 3, 2021
