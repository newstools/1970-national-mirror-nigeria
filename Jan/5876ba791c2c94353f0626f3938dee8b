 Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has issued warning to Timo Werner ahead of the remainder of the season. Lampard has made it clear to the German international that he has to put in his best to be able to hold down his role in the Chelsea team. Werner was on a 12-game goalless run before the 4-0 win in the FA Cup against Morecambe, Lampard believes that the striker can pick up from that game and start to fire all cylinders.

With Leipzig and Germany, he played centrally, from the left, as a lone striker, and as one of two strikers. So there is definitely room for manoeuvre in how you use Timo.” Werner scored eight goals in his first 12 games for Chelsea but his strike against Morecambe in the FA Cup ended a barren run of more than two months. He added: “I think his performances have been pretty good and I think they will get better the more he works with his team-mates. I think it’s going slightly unspoken that a lot of players unless they are at a club like Chelsea, are given time to come into the team, come out of the team, feel their way in. Post Views:
