 Real Madrid and Liverpool target Kylian Mbappe has rejected a fresh offer from Paris Saint-Germain as he seeks a move out of Ligue 1. The report in AS claimed that the France international has rejected an offer from PSG and it is widely believed by many in the club that the 22-year-old star wants to leave this summer. Paris Saint Germain offered twice of his current wage in a bid for the former AS Monaco ace to sign a new deal but the case has remained the same, as it was not enough to convince the attacker to extend his deal to 2026 with the Ligue 1 Champions. Real Madrid and Liverpool are aware of the current development and they are prepared to pounce on the deal to sign Mbappe. Mbappe is likely to leave this summer if he continues to turn down offers from the clubâ€™s board and he likely to join Real Madrid or Liverpool this summer. Post Views:
