 DJ Cuppy’s lawyers Babajide Koku & Co. have served Davido’s logistics manager Isreal DMW a letter demanding a retraction and public apology over his claims of DJ Cuppy owing Zlatan. Isreal DMW made claims via his Instagram page that DJ Cuppy cheated Zlatan when they were friends and she didn’t compensate him for his feature on their hit song ‘Gelato’ which led to Zlatan blocking DJ Cuppy and denied knowing her in public. According to him: “Kudos to someone like Zlatan, who took a bold step by flushing a full fake friend like Cuppy who was just using his head all in the name of my papa na Otedola. Zlatan did a hit collabo with her, ordinary one kobo, he no see. ‘’She also took Zlatan to Abuja for her fundraising where she made billions of naira and didn’t even remember Zee for one kobo until tomorrow. “No accommodation, no feeding. Zlatan had to even spend his own personal money at Transcorp Hilton to carter for everyone including me. Dis na 2021 abeg.” DJ Cuppy reacting to that, responded to lsreal that he would hear from her lawyers. Her lawyers in a letter to Isreal DMW have given him 7 days ultimatum to retract his statements and apologize publicly to DJ Cuppy over his comment which is defamation to her character and brand. The letter dated February 10, 2021 reads in part; “We, therefore, write to demand that you immediately cease and desist from all libellous and defamatory statements of our Client, her business and her brand. “Furthermore, we demand that within seven days of receipt of this letter; (i) You write a letter to be shared with the public containing a suitable withdrawal and apology in terms to be approved by us on our Clients behalf.
