 Ghanaian actress, Rosemond Alade Brown, aka Akuapem Poloo, has appealed the 90-day jail term handed her for publishing an obscene photograph on social media. The notice of appeal was filed Monday (April 19, 2021) by Polooâ€™s lawyer, Mr Andrews Vortia, at the Accra High Court [Criminal Court 2 Division]. Akuapem was jailed last Friday by the Accra Circuit Court, presided over by Ms Christiana Mann, for publishing a nude picture of herself in which she was with her son. She is premising her appeal on two grounds, Firstly, she argues that she was a first time offender and therefore the Circuit Court should had considered her plea of guilty as a mitigating factor when imposing the sentence. Secondly, the convicted actress argues that the trial judge should had imposed a fine on her instead of a custodial sentence. She has also filed an application for bail pending the determination of her appeal. Her legal team is expected to move the motion of notice of appeal and the bail on Wednesday , April 21, this year at the Accra High Court.
