 Napoli gaffer, Genaro Gattuso has expressed his relief and delight after Super Eagles towering striker returned to his starting line-up on Wednesday night in a Copa Italia tie against Atalanta. Atalanta beat Napoli 3-1 to set up a final cracker against Juventus, but Osimhen’s return was one of Gattuso’s cheering news of the night as the Nigerians continue to work hard to claw his way back to top form. The AC Milan legend believes the former Lille striker has a lot to offer the club but would need more time to knock himself back to top form. “It’s not easy to be at the top of the game after being out for 94 days. “He’s still lacking that sharpness, which is his main asset, but he’s gradually making progress. He’s capable of much more”, Gattuso told Napoli website. The towering striker was injured during Nigeria/ Sierra Leone AFCON Clash last November when he fell awkwardly on his wrist and had to be flown back to Naples where he was later tested positive to Covid-19. Osimhen scored his first goal in Italian Serie A last October in Napoli’s 4-1 victory over Atalanta at the San Paolo Stadium. The former Lille of France striker, who was in terrific form for the Naples during the pre-season, had failed to score after three league games. Post Views:
