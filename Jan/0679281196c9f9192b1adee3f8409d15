 Food vlogger, Sisi Yemmie is showing us how to make Abak Atama Soup, a popular soup among the Ibibios of Akwa Ibom State in Southern Nigeria. The two main ingredients, Palm Fruit Concentrate (Abak) and Atama Leaves give it its name. The base palm fruit concentrate used in the preparation of Abak Atama is similar to the Niger Delta’s Banga soup and the Igbos’ Ofe Akwu, but the spices and vegetables used in both of these soups and stews vary.
