It was also a year full of lemons, lemons that God turned into lemonades and cocktails. It is Year 27 and I am full of gratitude. I am grateful for life! I am grateful for the favour of God that has found me. I am grateful for the experiences that moulded me, the brightness of my present and my very glorious future. I am grateful for the overwhelming Love that surrounds me. I am grateful for the Elite LeagueðŸŒŸ
