 The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God Worldwide, Pastor Enoch Adeboye, on Friday night during the monthly Holy Ghost service of the church at the Redemption Camp, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State, broke his silence on the death of his son Late Pastor Dare adeboye. . During his ministration, which was also broadcast to members through Dove TV, he said God was sovereign and could not be queried for his actions. . He said, “Whatever we have is given to us by God, be it wealth, wife, husband, children e.t.c and if it got taken away by God, all we can do is give God glory for actually giving us the privilege to enjoy those wealth or kids temporarily and it is not for us to complain, blame and question God. . “What we see as sorrows might be joy in the sight of God, I mean His ways and thoughts are not the same with ours, we shouldn’t forget that both good and bad happen at God’s command. . “Finally, in all things, let’s learn to say thank you Father, and it is well. God bless all of you in Jesus’ name.”
