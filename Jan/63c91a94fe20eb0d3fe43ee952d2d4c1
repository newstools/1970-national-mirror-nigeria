Hi there BellaNaija Weddings Fam! Hope youâ€™ve had a great week? Itâ€™s been all shades of awesome on our end.Â  Every day in the week has literally just been like the weekend. So, now that the real weekend is finally here, thereâ€™s a lot to unpack. Weâ€™ve been basking in the euphoria of #AFreeUnion. From the proposal to the wedding, everything was a hit back to back. However, as they sayâ€¦ If itâ€™s not in photos, then it never happened. Well, this one did happen and there are tons of amazing photos to prove it! Whatâ€™s more? This did not in any way, hinder our daily flow of awesome Aww goodness, only tripled it! So, while we were enjoying all the thrill from Notey and Chibuzorâ€™s surprise proposal alongsideÂ Kemi and Dolapoâ€˜s #AFreeUnion Wedding, we also had other super sweet love stories, bridal beauty looks and bridal inspo, weddings and pre-weddings to share. Itâ€™s best you experience it all yourself. So, if youâ€™ve missed anything from this week, then brace yourself for the awesome ride into love heaven! Weâ€™ve got everything right here. Just click on each title link to enjoy. Cheers! ðŸ˜‰
