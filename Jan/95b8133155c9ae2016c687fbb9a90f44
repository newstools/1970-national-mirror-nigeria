A statement to this effect,Sunday,by the university’s Head, Information and Public Relations,Dr Habib Yakoob,explained that,”The partnership which will also address the dearth of Diabetologists and other health care professionals who play a critical role in the study and management of diabetes, would lead to the award of Master’s degree in Diabetes Education by the University of Abuja with support from Diabetes Africa in the form of experience, expertise and fundraising.’ “The virtual signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) which took place simultaneously in the United Kingdom and University of Abuja, Nigeria, over the weekend, was also witnessed online by the Eastern African Diabetes Study group from Kenya,” it further explained. The statement read further: “Vice-Chancellor Professor Abdul-Rasheed Na’Allah, while commending the initiative, said the University was going to be a pacesetter in this programme. “I express total support for this collaboration. I hope it is going to be a mark in the training in this area of professionalism, better knowledge management and treatment in Africa,” he said at the signing of the memorandum. “The VC added that the University would ensure that the collaboration brings about the strengthening of health services especially with regard to treatment of diabetes in the country. “Facilitator of the partnership and Dean of the Faculty of Clinical Sciences, Professor Felicia Anumah, said the burden of the complications of diabetes in Nigeria was quite high because of the poor-quality care and the unaffordability of medications and blood glucose monitoring devices by many patients. She said it had been the dream of the College of Health Sciences of the University to make impact in this area by starting a programme in diabetes. “Professor Anumah said the programme in diabetes education which would also have international faculties would be run on a dual-mode with virtual lectures and then clinical which will take place in some identified centres across the country. “I am very grateful to Diabetes Africa for being interested in this and being ready to support us in this venture. It is a day that I feel partly fulfilled; thank you very much”, Professor Anumah stated. “In a brief remark the Chairman of the Eastern African Diabetes Study group, Professor Silver Bahendeka said diabetes education cannot be under-rated given the alarming rate of the disease and its complications, adding that it’s heartwarming to see that the University has taken the lead in establishing the programme and looking forward to seeing the involvement of other institutions across Africa as Diabetes Africa rolls out programmes. “We have been looking forward to someone to take the lead and now that the University of Abuja has done it; congratulations,” Bahendeka said. “While lauding the commitment of the University of Abuja to the venture, the CEO of Diabetes Africa, Dr. Greg Tracz noted that Covid-19 had shown the whole world that the dichotomy between non-communicable and communicable diseases needed to be surmounted. “He said people living with diabetes were at high risk of contracting a range of communicable diseases and so “we believe strongly in tackling diabetes in all possible ways and the most impactful way to tackle diabetes as early as possible is through education.”
