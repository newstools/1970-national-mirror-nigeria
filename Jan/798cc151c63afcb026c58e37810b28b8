He wrote:
“The beauty and challenge of parenthood is that as tightly as you would like to hold on to your precious one, you continually need to let go”. I now truly understand that there is nothing like seeing your tiny tod all grown up and dressed in the bridal attire for her Big Day. I must tell you, there is no such sacred bond like father and daughter. Today has been such a roller- coaster ride of emotions for me, looking at my little angel dressed up as the most beautiful ‘Bride’ in her ‘Nikah Wedding Dress’. Surely, this is a momentous time in every parent’s life. Letting go of your daughter is not a simple act but this is an inevitable part that cannot be dodged no matter how badly you want to. Oyindamola and Olajuwon, I wish you both great happiness together I believe that not only will your love last, it will be a proof to all who surround you that love is beautiful, kind and enduring #TheOJLoveStory2021
Pasuma gave out his daughter’s hand in a marriage yesterday April 8 in a colorful wedding ceremony and whilst he was dancing to music performed by his colleague, Kwan 1, he shed tears of joy.
