 AbdulRasheed Bawa The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has raised an alarm over some Twitter accounts purportedly belonging to Abdulrasheed Bawa, chairman of the commission. In a statement on Sunday, Wilson Uwujaren, spokesperson of the EFCC, said some of the fake accounts gained large followership after Bawa’s appointment in February. Some of the fake accounts listed include @AbdurasheedBawa, @AbdulrBawa and @AbdulRashidBawa1. “One of the fake Twitter handles, @AbdulRashidBaw1, which was created in February following the appointment of Bawa as EFCC Chair, has witnessed a steady stream of followers, an indication that many have been hoodwinked into believing they were dealing with the EFCC chair,” the statement read. “The commission is alarmed that this prank by unscrupulous elements is unwittingly exposing suspecting citizens to potentially grievous manipulation by fraudsters. “Against this background, it is imperative to again warn that, these Twitter accounts are fake and have no link whatsoever with Mr Abdulrasheed Bawa, executive chairman, EFCC.” The commission also warned the promoters of the fake accounts to desist from their actions or face the wrath of the law as it “amount to impersonation or identity theft which is a criminal offence under the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc.,) Act 2015.”
