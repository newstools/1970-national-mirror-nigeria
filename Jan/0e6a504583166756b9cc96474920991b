 Despite ending Saturday in second place, Manchester United can see the title slipping from their grasp after a 0-0 draw vs Arsenal with plenty of missed chances. However, they should bounce back against Southampton, given that they have won nine (L1) of their last ten Premier League (PL) fixtures played against teams that ended Saturday in the bottom half. Yet, that sole defeat (vs Sheffield United) lifted their loss rate as home league favourites up to 44.44% (W4, D1, L4) – by far the worst amongst last season’s top four. Curiously, both of their home league games played in 2021 have ended 2-1, seeing the losing side claim Goal 2 after a first half lost 1-0, with the decisive goal then arriving between the 61st-75th minute of play. As for Southampton, three straight league defeats have seen their winning start to 2021 fade quickly from memory, with all league results this year coming after a first half won/lost by a one-goal margin. They’ve also failed to score in five of their last seven PL games. The visitors have suffered only one away league defeat since the end of the October international break (W2, D4, L1). Some of the results in that sequence of road trips have contributed to the ‘Saints’ current 50% draw rate as PL away outsiders this term. Odds Manchester United are on 1.50 odds for the win with a Southampton win coming with odds of 6.60 and a draw is priced at 4.95. Betting Tip Manchester United appears to have slightly gone off-steam but our bookies still have them for a win or a draw and Betpay is offering odds of 1.08 for that possibility. Prediction Manchester United to win or draw. Post Views:
