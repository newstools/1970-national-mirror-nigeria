 Serie A side, Napoli have officially announced their Nigerian striker Victor Osimhen has now tested negative for coronavirus. This is indeed a big relief for Osimhen who had first tested positive for coronavirus on New Year’s day on arrival from Nigeria after a short holiday and also returned positive when a fresh round of test was carried out on him last week. 😍 | Victor #Osimhen has recovered from #COVID19 💪 💙 #ForzaNapoliSempre pic.twitter.com/xebQoZ6Hw9 — Official SSC Napoli (@en_sscnapoli) January 22, 2021 Having been certified okay now, Osimhen is expected to hit the ground running straight as he is expected to join his Napoli teammates in training. Before testing positive for COVID-19, Osimhen has been out with a shoulder injury since the international duty with Nigeria.
