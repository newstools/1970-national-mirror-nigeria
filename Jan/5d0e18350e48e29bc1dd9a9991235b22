 Contrary to reports that Liverpool’s talisman Mohamed Salah is unhappy at the club and wants out, German manager Jurgen Klopp has quelled such speculations. The Egyptian was introduced from the bench last weekend against Palace and he scored twice with an assist but had a tamed celebration – which increased speculations that he is seeking a move away from Anfield. “We never speak about deals, why should we start now?” Klopp told reporters. “Mo is in a good mood, a good moment, really good shape so that is the most important thing. “You would have seen him laughing a lot in training, he enjoyed the session. All the rest is nice for all of you to write about but internally, no.” Klopp added: “I think all these things to talk about, he didn’t start the last game, all the things I heard after and then he came on and scored two. “His first season he came on against Stoke and scored two. All the boys were in a good moment, that is why we had the points we have so far. “That is why we have to keep going. The toughest point of the season is ahead of us. The Xmas period is always tough so we have to make sure we get through this.” Salah has scored 110 goals in 173 appearances for Liverpool, winning the UEFA Champions League and Premier League trophy. Salah will be on show on Sunday when Liverpool hosts West Brom at Anfield.
