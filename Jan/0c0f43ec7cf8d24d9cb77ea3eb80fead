 Manchester United will look to get into the top with a win as they welcome Wolves to Old Trafford and our partners Betpay brings you the preview and betting tips. A 2-2 draw at Leicester on Boxing Day kept Manchester United firmly in the title hunt and made it eight Premier League (PL) games unbeaten (W6, D2) for the division’s second highest top scorers (2.14 scored on average per fixture). Like that recent draw, the ‘Red Devils’ have been entertaining to watch with six of their last eight PL fixtures featuring over 3.5 goals, contributing to a high match goal average of 3.79 per PL game this term. In fact, the last match here witnessed United score 6+ goals in a PL game for the first time since August 2011, as they thrashed Leeds 6-2 having previously failed to score over 1.5 team goals in any of their opening six PL home games (W1, D2, L3). However, a poor start from either side could be easily rectified as this fixture features two of the division’s best comeback teams, as since the start of 2018/19 only Liverpool have picked up more points from losing positions than Man United (44) and Wolverhampton Wanderers (40). This game’s visitors proved those credentials last time out too, after they scored late on to grab a point versus Tottenham. However, despite that result, Wolves travel here with just one win from their last five matches (W1, D1, L3), a run that coincides with the loss of star striker Raúl Jiménez. That doesn’t bode well for a team that’s slipping down the table after losing their last two PL away games at HT/FT. Odds United are priced 1.80 for a win while a draw is priced at 4.10. A Wolves’ win attracts odds of 5.25 odds. Betting Tip A potentially tough call but our tipsters believe it will be a slim Manchester United win and you stake on Betpay for odds of 1.80. Prediction Manchester United 2-1 Wolves
