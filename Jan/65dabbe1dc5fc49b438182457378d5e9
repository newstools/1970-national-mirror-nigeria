 AGF The Attorney-General of the Federation, Abubakar Malami has indicated that his office is not investigating the national chieftain of the All Progressives Congress, Bola Tinubu. He made this known in a recent interview on Channels Television on March 9 where he said; “The Office of the AGF, as you rightly know, has not taken any decision, has not filed or institute any action before any court in the land relating to Bola Ahmed Tinubu. But then, within the context of the law, as you rightly know, the EFCC and the Code of Conduct are all statutory bodies vested with statutory powers to act within the context of the law establishing them. So, I am not in a position to give you a precise answer. The Office of the AGF and its arm, which is the Director of Public Prosecutions, has not initiated any proceedings and no investigation has been instituted at its instance by any agency of the government be it EFCC or the Code of Conduct Bureau.”
