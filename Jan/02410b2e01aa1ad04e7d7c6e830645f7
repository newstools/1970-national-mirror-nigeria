 Champions Liverpool welcome West Brom to Anfield and our partners Betpay brings your the preview and betting tip. After ending five winless Premier League (PL) road trips with the largest victory in their top-flight history, Liverpool return to Anfield looking to extend their widely publicised 66 consecutive PL home games without defeat (W55, D11), in which they have averaged a tremendous 2.65 goals per game. That includes a perfect seven from seven this season, despite conceding first-half goals in five of those matches. Even more damning for visiting West Bromwich Albion is that league-leaders Liverpool have comfortably won their last 13 PL assignments at home to newly promoted opposition, with nine clean sheets assisting a commanding average winning margin of 2.54 goals. It gets worse for the visitors as West Brom concluded the last round as one of two PL clubs, alongside Sheffield United, to have started as a travelling outsider at least twice without winning (W0, D2, L5), in what is currently by far their worst start to a PL season of the last decade. The division’s second worst away side have at least covered the +1.5 goal handicap in each of their last three PL away fixtures against all opposition (D1, L2), having done so four times throughout the season. They’ve also done that in their last four PL trips to Anfield, suggesting they could be capable of a respectable scoreline. Odds The Premier League champions are on 1.12 odds to win, and 9.40 to draw. Then there are odds of 20.20 for a very unlikely West Brom win. Betting Tip A no-brainer, it appears and our tipsters have given this one to Liverpool and you can head to Betpay to stake on it with odds of 1.12. Prediction Liverpool 4-0 West Brom
