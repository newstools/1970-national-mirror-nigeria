 The US Department of Justice, has claimed that the surety provided by Abidemi Rufai, the suspended aide of Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state, is also a suspected fraudster. Recall Abidemi was arrested at the JFK International airport in the US when he attempted to leave the country for Nigeria. Upon his arrest, he was requested to provide a surety to post the $300,000 surety bond for his bail.US Department of Justice released a statement about the arrest. The statement read; “First, the FBI has conducted research into the Surety and has learned information indicating that the Surety is not an appropriate person to perform that role. “In 2015, the Surety’s bank (Bank of America) issued a report naming the Surety as a suspect in an investigation into an email impersonation scheme. “According to the bank’s report, a person purporting to be a donor deposited $134,000 into the bank account of a legitimate nonprofit. The “donor” (who was never identified) then contacted the non-profit and stated that some of the deposited funds were intended for a different recipient. “The donor asked the non-profit to wire the excess funds to three different accounts, one of which was a Bank of America account in the Surety’s name. The report indicates that the Surety then made cash withdrawals of the proceeds at two different B of A locations. The Surety did not respond to inquiries from Bank of America. “Second, FBI’s research was unable to confirm that the Surety owns the listed real property. Mortgage and deed records for the property indicate that it was last purchased by an individual with the initials L.S.G. on November 7, 2014. “The Surety has also submitted records showing that she has $335 in Robinhood investment account and $1,838 in a checking account. Neither submission suggests the Surety is in a position to secure a $300,000 bond.”
