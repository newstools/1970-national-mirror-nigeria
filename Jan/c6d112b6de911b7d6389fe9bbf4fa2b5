This disclosure was announced by the State Commissioner of Information, Jon Kalu on Thursday, saying immediate investigation has been launched to find out how the explosive landed in the school. The statement reads; “Abia State Government is currently working with relevant security agencies in the state to unravel the source and nature of the suspected explosive devices found at Union Primary School, Afaraukwu in Umuahia North LGA” The suspected explosives apparently makes evidence clear that they are antiques alleged to be from some period of civil war era. According to Jon Kalu, the government is still sticking around to get a report from the EOD squad of the Nigeria Police while investigation proceeds.

Operatives of security agencies have been ordered by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu to start proactive checks in any susceptible areas. This has heightened the level of tension in the schools and the area as a whole. Students have been asked to stay out of the heated zone until the matter is being taken care of by security operatives. Note: The image used above is just for illustration purposes.
