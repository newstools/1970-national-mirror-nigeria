 Aston Villa welcome Burnley to Villa park for one of the midweek fixtures and our partners Betpay brings you the preview complete with betting tips and guides. Stats Impressive Aston Villa have won six of their ten Premier League (PL) matches so far (W6, L4), and are subsequently five places and seven points better off than at the same stage of last season. Villa’s attack has been one of their most striking assets and their average of 2.1 goals scored per game is the division’s second best, although they have scored just once in each of their previous three matches. Worryingly though, Villa have lost three consecutive PL home matches and have also conceded 2+ goals in each of their previous four at home. A minor consolation is that they won the corner count in each of those three defeats, securing 6+ match corners in all three. Improving Burnley have lost only one of their previous five PL matches (W2, D2, L1), and despite a heavy loss away at Manchester City, boast a good recent defensive record which has seen them secure three clean sheets across their previous five matches. A lack of goals is an ongoing issue though, and they have scored just six times this PL campaign. A Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang own goal on Sunday handed the ‘Clarets’ their first PL away win (W1, D2, L3). The timing of that goal also continued an intriguing trend this season which has seen all of their goals arrive exclusively in either the opening 15 minutes of the match or inside the 61st to 75th minute segment. Odds An Aston Villa win has 1.85 odds on Betpay and for a draw, there is an offering of 4.05 odds. Going with a Burnley win will attract odds of 4.60. Betting Tip Burnley are coming off a 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates and will be in high spirits but that notwithstanding, tipsters have called it for a Villa win or a draw and that attracts odds of 1.17 that you can stake on Betpay. Prediction Aston Villa 2-1 Burnley
