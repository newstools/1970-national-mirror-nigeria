 President Muhammadu Buhari requested on Tuesday parliamentary approval for new external borrowing of $6.18 billion. Nigeria will seek to raise $3 billion or more in Eurobonds as part of the new debt, the president wrote in a letter to parliament detailing the borrowing plan. The money will partly be used to finance Nigeriaâ€™s 2021 budget deficit, going to projects in the power, transport and agriculture sectors, as well as education, health and defence, said Buhari.
