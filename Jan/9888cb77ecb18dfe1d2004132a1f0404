 Rochas Okorocha A high court in Imo has ordered the interim forfeiture of all the properties said to be acquired through “illegal means” by Rochas Okorocha, former governor of the state. Fred Njemanze, the presiding judge, gave the order following an ex parte application filed by Louis Alozie, a senior advocate of Nigeria (SAN). In the main substantive suit marked HOW/191/2021, the attorney-general of Imo state had sued Okorocha, his wife, Nkechi, and incorporated trustees of Rochas Foundation. In a motion ex parte brought pursuant to Section 472(1) of the Imo state administration of Criminal Justice Law No. 2 of 2020, Alozie prayed the court for an order of forfeiture on the grounds that the properties, which he said were for the public, “were converted to personal use by the first to third respondents (Okorocha, his wife, and the foundation) and their cronies for which the applicants now intends to recover them in line with the white paper by the judicial commission of inquiry’s report”.
