Il giocatore ripeterà il test in settimana. pic.twitter.com/zPfpwRdxgT — Official SSC Napoli (@sscnapoli) January 11, 2021 Osimhen had first tested positive on New Year’s Day on arrival in Naples from Lagos. He has since been self-isolating but ten days after, Napoli announced the player remains positive.  While in Lagos, it was gathered that Osimhen attended a surprise birthday party where it was believed he contracted the virus. However, the 21-year old has issued an apology even as he corrected insinuations he was being wayward during the yuletide celebrations. He said: “I am so sorry for what happened, I was wrong to go to Nigeria in this moment, even if I have many loved ones over there, including my brothers. “I was wrong to take part in the party. I didn’t understand the severity of what I was doing. I apologise to the club, the coach, the team, and the fans.” Having acquired the 21-year old for a record transfer fee, Napoli will be pained by the turn of events in the past three months.
