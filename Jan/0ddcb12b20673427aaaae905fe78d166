 For the first in almost 40 years, Liverpool on Sunday lost a third straight home game as they were thrashed 4-1 by a rampant Manchester City team in the super Sunday Premier League clash Pep Guardiola’ men extended their lead at the Premier League summit to five points with the thumping victory over Liverpool on Sunday. Reds goalkeeper Alisson put up a shambolic second-half performance on Merseyside, while Ilkay Gundogan scored twice after an earlier penalty miss. Raheem Sterling notched a header and the excellent Phil Foden netted a sensational late goal as dominant City won at Anfield for the first time since 2003. 10 – Phil Foden has now scored 10 goals across all competitions this season; among those in double figures across Europe's top five leagues, only Erling Haaland (20y 201d) is younger than Foden (20y 255d).

Meanwhile, Liverpool – who also lost at Brighton in midweek – stay fourth and are now 10 points off the top after back-to-back defeats and another hammer blow to their title defence. Liverpool are the first side to lose three straight home league matches in the following campaign after winning the English top-flight since Chelsea did so almost 65 years ago back in March 1956 Post Views:
