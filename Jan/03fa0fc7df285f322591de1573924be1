 Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen was benched for the third straight game following his return from shoulder injury and coronavirus as Napoli beat Parma 2-0 at the Stadio Diego Maradona. The 21-year-old, who started from the bench against Verona in the Serie A and during the win over Spezia in the Coppa Italia quarter finals, was again selected by manager Gennaro Gattuso in the match-day squad against Parma but this time he did not see a minute of action suggesting that his fitness levels are not up to speed. Andrea Petagna, Hirving Lozano and Lorenzo Insigne were given the nod to start as the front three for Napoli but it was Eljif Elmas that proved decisive for the home side in the first half after he coolly slotted in a pass from Diego Demme. Napoli were on the back foot for most of the second half and Gattuso snubbed the opportunity of introducing Osimhen, who has missed upto three months of football and instead brought on Matteo Politano for Andrea Petagna and the Italian repaid the manager’s trust with the second goal of the encounter which effectively sealed a 2-0 win for the Azzurri’s. The win takes Napoli into fourth on the Serie A log with 37 points while sit 19th with just 13points after 20 matches so far this season. Post Views:
