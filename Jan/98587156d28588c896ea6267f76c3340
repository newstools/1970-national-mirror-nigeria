 Manager of Victor Osimhen at Napoli , Gennaro Gattuso says he would love to die on a football pitch after revealing that he struggles with an auto-immune disease. During Napoli’s 2-0 defeat to Lazio in Rome last Sunday and the 1-1 against Torino on Wednesday, Gattuso wore an eye patch on the touchline as he suffers from an auto-immune disease known as ocular myasthenia. “I admit I’ve not been myself for the last 12 days,” Gattuso told a news conference, having skipped media duties for the club’s previous outing. “I want to make an appeal to all those, especially kids, who look in the mirror and see something that looks odd or not quite right: life is beautiful. Embrace it all. “The lads suffered too seeing me like this, I know that, but I’m alive. I’ve had myasthenia for 10 years, this is the third time it has flared up this badly, but it’ll pass and my eye will return to normal. “It’s not just that it looks bad, this condition makes you feel really exhausted, plus seeing double 24 hours a day really takes it out of you. Only a crazy person like me would keep going. “However, this is my life and there are worse things. I know some out there already assume I’ve got a month left to live, but I can assure you, it’s fine. When I eventually die, I want to go where I lived, on a football pitch.”
