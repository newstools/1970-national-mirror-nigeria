Time and again, we’re reminded about the beauty of marrying your best friend. It’s just such a big flex! 😅 Mika and Oghale‘s pre-wedding shoot has us all giddy and feeling like high school teenagers. From the sultry poses to the playful vibes, we love everything about these photos. It’s so easy to see how greatly they’re into each other. All 3 of Mika’s outfits oozes so much class. And Oghale shines through in his dapper outfits. Mika and Oghale are evidently happily in love and we can’t help but love their love! 😍 See all the adorable photos below.
