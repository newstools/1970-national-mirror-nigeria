 Henry Onyekuru will wear the jersey number 7 as he re-joins Galatasaray on loan for the rest of the season. The Super Eagles winger has failed to shine since he left Everton permanently for AS Monaco, has finally returned to Turkey where he helped Galatasaray win the 2018-19 Turkish Super Lig title. “Someone said something, you know, the son of the hand, the son of the house. I swear to God, I think Onyekuru is the son of the house,” Cengiz told the club website. “For the third time, he insisted on asking for us thanks to Onyekuru, even though there were many teams who wanted him and it cost a lot to the club he came from. “He didn’t even look back on offers from other teams in Turkey or abroad. We thank him very much for his feelings of belonging and loyalty in this context. It’s a stance. He didn’t prefer money. He preferred his love.” AS Monaco outcast Henry Onyekuru has returned to Galatasaray on a six-month loan that elapses at the end of the season, with an option to buy. After completing spells in Belgium and Galatasaray – where he won the 2018-19 Turkish Super Lig title, he was sold permanently to Ligue 1 giants Monaco. Onyekuru’s best individual season in Europe was for Eupen where he finished the 2016-17 Belgian First Division A season as joint top-scorer with 22 goals, which led to his £7 million move to Everton.
