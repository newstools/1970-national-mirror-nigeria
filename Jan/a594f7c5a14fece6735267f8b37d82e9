 Everton manager Carlo Ancelotti has revealed the biggest strength of Super Eagles midfielder Alex Iwobi after he helped his side to a comprehensive 2-0 victory over Leicester City on Wednesday night. Iwobi had the better of compatriots, Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho as he grabbed an assists in the Toffees win at the King Power Stadium. “It’s his [Iwobi’s] best moment since I arrived [at Everton],” Ancelotti told the Everton website. “He is showing confidence, is really good in one-versus-one situations and he is working hard. The key is to work hard – the team is working hard. I said to the players that we have to be satisfied but we have to work and we have to improve.” Ndidi, who was making his second start in the premier league after a long injury layoff was played at center back alongside Wesley Fofana while Iheanacho replaced Nampalys Mendy in the 73rd minute and Iwobi made way for Jonjoe Kenny in the 90th minute. The visitors took the lead courtesy Brazilian forward Richarlison. The former Watford star slotted the ball past Kasper Schmeichel in goal for the Foxes after receiving a neat pass from Nigerian international, Alex Iwobi. It went from bad to worse for the home side as Everton defender Mason Holgate registered his first goal of the season to make it 2-0.  Leicester threw everything at Everton but Carlo Ancelotti’s men held on for the vital three points.
