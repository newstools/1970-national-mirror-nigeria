 Atiku Abubakar Former Vice President of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar has taken to social media to mourn the loss of his friend, Yinka Odumakin. Atiku described him as a great Nigerian, passionate leader and champion of a true Nigeria that would work for everyone. He expressed his sudden loss in losing him as he took to his Twitter page and paid his condolences. His post read: Yinka Odumakin was a patriot, advocate of good governance
I received the news of the death of my younger brother and friend, Yinka Odumakin with a rude shock. Odumakin was a patriot and strong believer in the promotion of good governance, democracy and the rule of law. I sympathize with all Nigerians who share these same values with Odumakin, especially the Afenifere group of which Yinka was the publicity secretary – a role he played with so much commitment and admiration. Much as our heart grieves over this unpleasant development, we must take solace in accepting it as an act of God and acknowledge the fact that Yinka lived a life of purpose in defense of the ordinary people of this country and to enthrone a better Nigeria. I condole with his wife, Dr (Mrs) Joe Okei-Odumakin and his children and pray that God will grant him eternal rest. Yinka Odumakin was a patriot and advocate of good governance, democracy and the rule of law. https://t.co/Gjt4bRp5zS pic.twitter.com/xwgTUw1vNB — Atiku Abubakar (@atiku) April 3, 2021
