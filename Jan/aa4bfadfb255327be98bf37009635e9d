 President Muhammadu Buhari Twitter has deleted President Muhammadu Buhari’s tweet, where he threatened to deal with secessionists “in the language they understand”. The President had released a series of tweets after meeting with the Chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, at the State House in Abuja on Tuesday, wherein he warned that those promoting insurrection and those sponsoring destruction of critical national assets would soon have the shock of their lives. Though the President put up five tweets after his meeting with Prof. Yakubu, Twitter took down the last tweet saying it violated its rules while the remaining four tweets were retained.
