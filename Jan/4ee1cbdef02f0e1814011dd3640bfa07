 Alex Iwobi has departed Super Eagles camp after tested positive for Coronavirus and will not be available for selection for tomorrow’s final Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Lesotho. The 24-year-old Everton forward tested positive for Covid-19 upon arrival in Benin ahead of Super Eagles 1-0 win over Squirrels. Iwobi travelled back to Nigeria with the rest of the squad on Sunday before heading back to England. Super Eagles spokesman Babafemi Raji told AFP. “Iwobi has left the camp,” “Before he left, he did not show any symptoms, he was fine.” Iwobi has scored twice during the qualifying campaign for the delayed Africa Cup of Nations, which will be hosted by Cameroon in January next year.
