 A shock 3-0 defeat at the hands of fourth-tier Crawley in the FA Cup last weekend gave Leeds a fifth competitive game from the last six that produced a 3+ goal margin (W3, L3). Considering that penchant for high margins, it’s little surprise Leeds have been the Premier League’s (PL) entertainers this season, averaging a league-high 3.71 total goals per match, although they remain in mid-table obscurity. While the hosts’ gung-ho approach can often be their downfall, their last home match produced a Leeds PL home win ‘to nil’ for the first time since April 2003. That’s given them the opportunity to register a third consecutive PL victory at Elland Road for the first time in a single season since 2000/01, as they look to further increase their 62.5% unbeaten rate here this top-flight campaign (W3, D2, L3). Brighton travel here on a nine-game winless PL run – the division’s worst current streak – which has plunged them to the edge of the relegation zone (D5, L4). Several worrying signs have been building up, with an own goal conceded in their first game of 2021 giving them their ninth such conceded PL goal since the ‘Seagulls’ were promoted in 2017 – no side has conceded more during that period. They have also failed to score in three of their last four PL away games (D2, L2), although Brighton did manage to score twice in four of their previous six trips here. Considering they remain unbeaten when netting first on the road this PL campaign (W2, D1), repeating those H2H feats could be their route away from the relegation zone. Odds A stake on a Leeds win guarantees 2.30 odds on Betpay and 3.15 odds for a Brighton win and if you stake on a draw, then there are guaranteed odds of 3.85. Betting Tips The bookies believe it is a game either side can win (with odds of 1.23 on Betpay) and tip the game to record over 1.5 goals and that comes with 1.22 odds. Prediction Any side to win and over 1.5 goals. Post Views:
