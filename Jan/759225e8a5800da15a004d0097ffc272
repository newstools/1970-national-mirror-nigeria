 Jack Dorsey Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is selling his first tweet ever on the Twitter App. The tweet from March 21, 2006 reads “Just setting up my twttr,” just setting up my twttr — jack (@jack) March 21, 2006 Dorsey, who is the CEO of Square SQ in addition to Twitter TWTR, is selling the tweet as a non-fungible token, or NFT. An NFT is a verifiable digital asset vouchsafed by blockchain technology. NFTs are not exchangeable like currencies — as each is unique and can’t be replicated. Traditional currencies are fungible, meaning they are interchangeable and can be divided into smaller fractions. The winner of the auction for Dorsey’s tweet will receive “a digital certificate of the tweet, unique because it has been signed and verified by the creator.” The auction winner will also get the metadata of the original tweet including “when the tweet was posted, what the text contents are of the tweet, the timestamp of the tweet, and the digital signature from the creator’s crypto wallet address.“ Jack tweeted a link to the listing, the tweet currently has highest bid of $2.5 million. https://t.co/xCnWG9EqgD — jack (@jack) March 6, 2021
