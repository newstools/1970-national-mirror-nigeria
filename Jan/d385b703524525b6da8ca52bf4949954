 Alex Iwobi misses Nigeria’s Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Benin after testing positive for coronavirus, according to reports in the local media. The attacker tested positive for Covid-19 upon arrival in Benin ahead of Saturday’s showdown between the Super Eagles and the Squirrels. The news comes as a major blow for Gernot Rohr as he looks to get the Eagles over the line and secure their ticket to Cameroon. The attacking midfielder has been a key figure under the German coach, and would almost certainly have started for the West Africans had he been available.
