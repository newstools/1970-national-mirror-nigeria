 Semi Ajayi on target again in West Brom 3-2 comeback win over Wolves to claim Derby bragging rights in the Premier League encounter at Molineux Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Matheus Pereira gave the visitors an early lead from the penalty spot in the eight minutes of the Black Country derby clash after Ivory Coast defender illy Boly’s foul on Callum Robinson. However, Wolves hit back as two goals in five minutes from Fabio Silva and Boly two minutes before the break to send Nuno Espírito Santo side with the lead going to half time. The topsy-turvy nature of the game didn’t stop there as West Brom responded early in the second half through Super Eagles defender Semi Ajayi to scored his third of the season in all competitions thus far. Pereira completes his brace in the Premier League at Molineux Stadium in the 56th minutes from the spot again after Conor Coady brought down Robinson.  Wolves piled forward in numbers for an equaliser, but West Brom defended resiliently to seal the maximum points and give Sam Allardyce’s first win in charge of Albion. The result extended a miserable run for Wolves, who since striker Raul Jimenez fractured his skull at Arsenal on 29 November have taken five points from nine games and slid down the table into 14th spot, while West Brom, who stay 19th, move onto 11 points, three adrift of safety Post Views:
