Speaking in an interview, the popular Nigerian artist Chidinma Ekile disclosed that her conversion and the decision that led her to the gospel music fraternity, why she chose Eezed Concept, and what her fans should expect from her. A Few weeks after Chidinma Ekile switched into doing gospel music, she signed with popular record label Eezed concept and also released her debut song titled, “Jehovah Overdo”. When asked what led her into doing gospel music, Chidinma said that her conversion is ordained by God. She disclosed that it was prophesied to her some time back so she is not surprised. “Well, it has been ordained. It was actually a prophecy, so I was going to get here anyway.

Chidinma has told her fans to expect the move of God in her music career and also her songs. She emphasized that although she is doing music, her main purpose is to do God’s work. ”Fans should expect the move of God. Yes, I’m going to do the music but most importantly, I’m here because of God. So, expect the move of God and expect to be blessed.” “The journey so far has been quite challenging. I’ve had to go through a whole lot of submission, prayer, and spending time with God. Prior to that, we all know how it has been before, and as I said, it is God who ordained that I’ll be a minister of the Gospel and this is just the right time for me to step into it. “So, the journey has kind of prepared me for this season, for this particular time. So, I’m here to do God’s work” she said.
