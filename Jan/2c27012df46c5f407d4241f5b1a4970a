 Liverpool come off the 2-1 win over Tottenham as they take a trip to London to face Crystal Palace and our partners Betpay brings us a preview and betting tips for the game. It’s been two London derbies and two 1-1 draws for Crystal Palace, who enter this match against the reigning champions on the back of just one win across their last five Premier League (PL) matches (W1, D2, L2). Palace famously derailed Liverpool’s title challenge in 2014 with a three-goal comeback here, but have now lost the six most recent PL H2Hs home and away, and with Liverpool scoring at least two goals in six straight visits to Selhurst Park (in all competitions)! Scoring 2+ goals is something the ‘Eagles’ have done themselves just four times this PL season, but they’ve won each time when doing so. Three of those four matches, however, came against teams currently below them in the table. Liverpool, meanwhile, enter the round three points above the rest after beating title rivals Tottenham 2-1 in the last round, courtesy of a 90th minute winner. It was the fourth time across their last five in the league (W3, D2) that the ‘Reds’ have scored the last goal of the game after the 75th minute. Their away exploits, however, differ wildly from their 100% home record in the PL. In fact, their seven points (W1, D4, L1) is better than just four teams going into this match, and 2.0 conceded goals on average is up from 0.89 from last season. Currently, just three teams have conceded as many or more goals than Liverpool in their away league matches (12) – although seven did come in one game! Odds Crystal Palace are priced on a massive 5.65 odds for the win while a draw attracts odds of 4.65. however, a Liverpool win is priced at 1.55. Betting Tip The champions are favourites for this win and our tipsters have them on 1.55 odds to deliver the goods and you can stake on Betpay for that. Prediction Crystal Palace 1-3 Liverpool
