 Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike has appealed to the Federal Government to give states the power to develop and manage their respective minerals and in turn, pay royalties to the central government. the Minister of State for Mines and Steel Development, Mr Uchechukwu Ogah, paid him a visit where the two deliberated on talks and how to move the State forward. “The federal government is carrying so much load that they are not supposed to carry, allow states to develop these minerals and pay royalty to the federal government, that is the way it’s supposed to be,” “It is very important for people to know that part of the problem in this country is that everybody is depending on oil, when we are also supposed to look at other minerals. “Minerals play a great role in terms of raising revenue for any country, so our overemphasis on oil has reduced our impact on other minerals. if the country fully harness the gold deposit in Zamfara as well as other minerals in other states of the federation, the country will make a lot of revenue from these minerals that can accelerate development. Mr Uchechukwu Ogah also commended the governor and said: “In addition, permit me to also remind you of the abundant sea salt yet to be exploited in Rivers as a state bordering the Atlantic Ocean, which might also be an interesting area for collaborative development,” “Your administration has accomplished its mission as seen in the massive infrastructures, cultural integration, provision of essential social amenities and many other legacy projects for the prosperity of Rivers State people and Nigerians living and doing businesses in the State,”
