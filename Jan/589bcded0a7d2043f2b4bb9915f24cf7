 Former Chelsea star Scott Parker has reacted after controversially VAR decision to disallowed Super Eagles striker Josh Maja goal in Fulham 1-0 defeat to Tottenham Hotspurs in the Premier League encounter at Craven Cottage. Fulham coach believes the video assistant referee is “killing” football’s excitement but added his side will not surrender in their fight to avoid relegation. They were unable to keep a third successive home clean sheet when Super Eaglest hopeful Tosin Adarabioyo inadvertently turned Dele Alli’s flick into his own net. Fulham thought they had equalised in the 62nd minute when Davinson Sanchez’s clearance rebounded off Mario Lemina and into the path of Super Eagles striker Maja, who produced a fine finish after the hour. Hiowever, Lemina was penalised for handball in the build-up despite his arm being by his side. “It is the rule – I think it’s crazy,” Parker told BBC Radio 5 Live. “I’m complaining at the rule. We want it to be the most entertaining league in the world, with goals. I don’t know what [Lemina] can do. We just need some common sense. We are trying to make football so pure and sterile it becomes unrealistic.” He added: “We want to see goals and excitement but I am sorry to say that VAR is killing every part of that. You are losing the raw emotion of the game we absolutely love.” Fulham will feel like it is another opportunity missed with a victory would have taken them out of the bottom three for the first time since Christmas – but remain in 18th.
