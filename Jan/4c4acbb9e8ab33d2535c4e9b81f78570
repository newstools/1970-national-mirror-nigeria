 Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta and Technical director Edu both delighted after signing Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid until the end of the season. The 22-year-old Norwegian has been struggling for playing time under Zinedine Zidane as the attacking midfielder featured nine times in all competitions for the La Liga champions this season. 👋 Welcome to The Arsenal, Martin Odegaard! 🇳🇴 — Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 27, 2021 Odegaard has been linked with a return loan move to Real Sociedad before he decided to join Arsenal for the rest of the season after the Gunners confirmed the signing on the club’s official website. Mikel Arteta said: “It’s great that we’ve secured Martin to come to us until the end of the season. Martin is of course a player that we all know very well and although still young, he has been playing at the top level for a while. “Martin will provide us with quality offensive options and we’re all excited to be integrating him into our plans between now and May.” Technical director Edu said: “We are delighted to welcome Martin to the club until the end of the season. I would like to thank everyone at Real Madrid and Martin’s representatives for their collaboration in making this loan move happen. “Martin is an exceptional talent and we are strengthening our squad by introducing an exciting offensive player to the club for the remaining months of this season.” Odegaard has been handed No.11 shirt and he becomes Arsenal’s second major signing of the January transfer window after goalkeeper Mat Ryan sealed a loan move from Brighton & Hove Albion last week. Gunners coach Arteta will be able to call upon Odegaard for Saturday’s clash in Premier League against Manchester United at Emirate Stadium. Post Views:
