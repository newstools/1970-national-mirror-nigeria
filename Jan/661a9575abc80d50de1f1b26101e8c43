 The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church Of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye has assured Nigerians that the victory over bandits would come soon. Pastor Adeboye paid a visit to Governor Nasir el-Rufai of Kaduna State at the Government House, where he disclosed to him that he remembers him in his prayers and insecurity plaguing the nation would end soon. He said: “We know that you have a problem that only God can solve. The problem is far beyond the abilities of any human being. We have known each other for years. I know the kind of person you are. I know you are tender hearted, I know how you definitely must be feeling, particularly when the kidnappings are going on. When they begin to kidnap school children, I know how you must be feeling.” We are praying for you and I believe God is going to answer the prayers. I am assuring you sir that the Almighty God is going to fight for you, He is going to fight for Kaduna State, He is going to fight for Nigeria.  When God begins to do what He alone can do, then the world will see it and they will glorify the name of God, and many people who may be criticizing you now, will probably see the other side of story.” Governor Nasir el-Rufai gave his remarks and noted that the nation demands a divine intervention more than at any time in its history. He said: ‘’We also seek your blessings and prayers, as a great man of God,  to assist us with the challenges that we are facing here and the country at large. This country needs divine intervention more than at any time in its  history. So, we are grateful for your prayers, we are grateful for your blessings, and we will continue to ask for more. “The Redeemed Christian Church has been a pillar of strength; a symbol of Nigeria’s unity and positive force for peace and progress in the state. And we are very grateful with the contributions that they have made.”
