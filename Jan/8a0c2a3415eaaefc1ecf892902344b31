 The rappers, who have been romantically linked since 2018, have apparently split as Saweetie confirmed on Twitter that she and Migos rapper Quavo have broken up. “I’m single,” she wrote. “I’ve endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character. Presents don’t band aid scars and the love isn’t real when the intimacy is given to other women.” Her tweet seems to suggest that Quavo had been caught cheating. The rapper has yet to respond to such allegations. “I emotionally checked out a long time ago and have walked away with a deep sense of peace and freedom,” she added in a second tweet. “Excited for this new chapter of elevation.” I’m single. I’ve endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character. Presents don’t band aid scars and the love isn’t real when the intimacy is given to other women. — 220 (@Saweetie) March 19, 2021
