Lil Wayne is apparently off the market for good. On Tuesday April 20, the Cash Money legend shared a tweet indicating he’d married girlfriend Denise Bidot and gave a nod to Outkast in the process. “Happiest man alive!” he wrote. “Today is the beginning of our forever. Forever?? Forever, ever?? FOREVER EVER!!! The Carters.” Happiest man alive! Today is the beginning of our forever. Forever?? Forever, ever??   FOREVER EVER!!!!!  The Carters. — Lil Wayne WEEZY F (@LilTunechi) April 20, 2021 For months, people assumed the couple had called it quits after what appeared to be a public break up on social media. But last week, Lil Wayne and Bidot returned to Instagram with a lovey-dovey post, indicating they were still very much a couple. Taking to his Instagram Stories, the multi-platinum rapper shared a video of Bidot drawing a heart in the sand and writing “Denise and Dwayne” in the center. She looked at the camera and blew him a kiss before it came to an end. The couple first went public with their relationship in June 2020 after Bidot shared a series of photos to her Instagram Stories cozying up to Weezy.
