 Actor, Yomi Fabiyi has once again taken to his Instagram handle to protest against what he termed, “human rights violation”. According to Yomi, Baba Ijesha is being detained illegally and if nothing is done about it, he will embark on an “Imminent Peaceful Protest, along with his supporters”. Baba Ijesha was arrested by the Lagos Police Command after he was seen in a CCTV footage sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl whom he’s also said to have abused seven years ago.
