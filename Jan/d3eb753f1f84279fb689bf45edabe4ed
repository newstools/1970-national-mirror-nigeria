 Leader of Living Faith Church,Bishop David Oyedepo has criticized the forceful way some health practitioners are injecting people with the COVID-19 vaccination. Bishop Oyedepo spoke during his church’s Covenant Hour of Prayer programme, where he called out the people forcing people to take the vaccine. He dared them to come to him and try to inject him. In his words: “A generation where people are forced to take vaccines. It is inhuman; it is immoral sir. I’m not a lawyer, but I do not think it is legal. You can’t come to my house and want to give me injections. “On what? Did I invite you? They are confused. But the church has the answer. Did you see any outbreak of virus here? How will it enter the gate? Will it come through the air? “How? One woman just got down after that injection in Kaduna. What kind of life? Are human beings now turned to guinea pigs? The world is confused but the church is lighted. “So the triumph of the church will humble the pride of the world. They don’t know what to do sir. In the last days, the church will be reigning in power and glory. That is God’s agenda. “No apologies. There is a big, big bird in our land, saying ‘don’t take it, they are deceivers’. Let me see someone who will come and inject me. By who? “Are you going to tie my hands? How? Did I invite you? I know you are quiet, you will hear more of it. My job is to expose the devil and tell his agents, ‘get off, we are not guinea pigs.”
