 US President, Joe Biden has called Russian President Vladimir Putin, a callous and wicked person as he said Russia would definitely see the consequence for interfering in the 2020 U.S. elections. Biden was engaged in a recent interview with ABC, where he spoke about the US relation to Russia and the implications of the Kremlins interference in the US elections. The U.S. intelligence community issued a report that determined that Putin supported election influence in Trumps favour to cast away public confidence in the election. In his words: “He will pay a price. We had a long talk, he and I. I know him relatively well and the conversation started off, I said, ‘I know you and you know me. If I establish this occurred then be prepared,” “I said, ‘I looked in your eyes and I don’t think you have a soul.’ He looked back and said we understand each other.Look, the most important thing in dealing with foreign leaders in my experience, and I’ve dealt with an awful lot of them in my career, is just know the other guy.”
