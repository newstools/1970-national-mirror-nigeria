 Mr Macaroni And Other Protesters Have Been Arrested At The Lekki Tollgate Comedian Debo Adebayo, better known as Mr Macaroni, has been arrested alongside other Peaceful Protesters at the Lekki toll gate. The comedian joined other protesters at the tollgate to express his dissatisfaction with the decision of the Lagos State Judicial Panel of Inquiry allowing the Lekki Concession Company to reopen the Lekki tollgate on Saturday. Mr Macaroni was arrested after the police told him “we don’t want you here”. In an Instagram live before his phone and those of other arrested protesters were seized, the comedian lamented that “Lekki is under military rule.” He said, “How did you think the reopening of tollgate is the next line of action? If you didn’t do that today, we won’t have a right to be here. “It is a disrespect to say that you want to reopen at this tollgate. Are you spitting on the graves of the dead?” The Federal Government and the police had earlier warned youths who planned to protest at the Lekki tollgate on Saturday, February 13 to have a rethink and shelve the protests.
