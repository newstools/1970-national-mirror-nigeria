 A 2-0 win over Southampton last time out further solidified Leicester City’s credentials as title challengers, and extended their unbeaten streak in all competitions to six games (W4, D2). They scored either side of HT in that match, and it’s Leicester’s second-half performances that have got them to where they are currently, with the ‘Foxes’ turning a league-high six HT draws into FT wins this Premier League (PL) campaign. However, they’ll be up against it here if recent history is anything to by, as Leicester are winless in the last four PL H2Hs they’ve hosted (D2, L2), although they should challenge from the off considering they’ve netted before HT in four of their last five competitive home games. Still, Brendan Rodgers will likely be disappointed with his side’s PL home form so far (W4, D1, L4). Chelsea put a halt to their three-game winless league streak with a 1-0 win at Fulham thanks to their 11th strike after the 75th minute this PL campaign – the second-highest tally during that time period, behind only opponents Leicester (12). That result also means the ‘Blues’ have recorded the same goals scored per PL match average (1.83), and conceded average (1.17), as their hosts this term! That recent win – and Chelsea’s 800th PL away goal – ended a three-game losing run away from home, but was also their fourth away clean sheet of the PL campaign, a vast improvement on the sole PL clean sheet they managed on the road throughout the entirety of 2019/20. Odds Staking on a Leicester win attracts 2.85 odds while a Chelsea win draws 2.50 odds and a draw is priced at 3.60 odds. Betting Tip Leicester are in better form but the bookies believe it is a game that can go either way and you can stake on that possibility on Betpay with odds of 1.26. Prediction Either side to win.
