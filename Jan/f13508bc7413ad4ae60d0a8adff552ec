 Nigerian striker, Asisat Oshoala, has made history becoming the first Nigerian and African female player to win the UEFA Womens Champions league. This is after she helped Barcelona defeat Chelsea in the final on Sunday night, May 16. Oshoala scored a fifth goal in the closing stages of the game, but it was ruled offside.
Before the game in Gothenburg, the four-time African Womenâ€™s Player of the Year claimed that Barca had learned from their final defeat to Lyon in 2019.
