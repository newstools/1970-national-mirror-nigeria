 American talk show host, Oprah Wifrey has disclosed that she was caught a little bit off guard when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle opened up to her on their encounter with racism in the royal family. Oprah had a chat with Nancy O’Dell on talkshoplive where she reveled how she asked them on how they wanted to open up even before they met for the interview. She said: “Whenever I’m doing interviews with anybody for anything that is significant, I have a conversation with them before. “I didn’t see Harry and Meghan before but I did text them and say intention is very important to me, tell me what your intention is, so that we can be aligned in our goal. And our shared intention was the truth. They wanted to be able to tell their story and tell it in such a way that allowed them to be as truthful as possible.” “The reason why it was such a powerful interview first of all, I know how to ask questions, and you [Nancy] know how to ask questions, we all know how to do our jobs, but what makes it powerful is when you have someone else who is willing to be as open, as vulnerable, as truthful, as they were. “So, I don’t give myself credit for that, I give myself credit for asking the questions, but the reason the interview was what it was, was because they answered the way they did.” she added.
