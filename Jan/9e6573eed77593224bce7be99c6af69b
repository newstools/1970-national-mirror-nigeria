 Hamburger SV’s Xavier Amaechi has joined Karlsruher SC on loan for the rest of the season. The 20-year-old England international, who is of Nigerian descent is a product of the famous Arsenal youth academy has struggled to have his career at club level going. Amaechi made a move to Hamburg in the summer of 2019 but couldn’t break into the first team. In a bid to get more playing time he has been shipped out to Karlsruhe. The Bath-born winger said: “I’m happy to be here in Karlsruhe now and want to play football here week after week.” On 13 November 2019, Amaechi made his England U19 debut during the 4-0 2020 U19 EURO qualifying win over Luxembourg.[11] A year later, Amaechi made his U20 debut and scored during a 2-0 victory over Wales at St. George’s Park on 13 October 2020.
