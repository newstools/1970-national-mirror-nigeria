 Super Eagles vice-captain William Troost-Ekong is targeting victory over Mikel Obi’s Stoke City on Friday in the Championship. The former Udinese defender was brilliant last term for the Hornets as they defeated Barnsley 1-0 on Tuesday evening courtesy a first half penalty by Troy Deeney. “I’ve just been in the changing room and everyone is very happy, but it won’t mean a lot unless we can get something again on Friday,” Troost-Ekong told Hive Live. “We need to close the week well and we’ve said we need to try and get on a run, so playing Stoke away is going to be a great opportunity for us. “We’ve done the basics and put the foundation in place to have a good week and get a good run going.” Troost-Ekong credited Watford’s 1-0 win over Barnsley to good preparation. “We were better prepared this time,” he continued. “We had to try and get revenge after what happened when we played them away. “They played real Championship football, it was a real battle tonight, but we did well to try and get the ball onto the ground and play as much as possible. “We knew this was going to be a massive week, we wanted to get as many points as we can to attack the top again and we did what we needed to do in the last two games at home.” Post Views:
