 Liverpool attacker Robert Firmino has begun to play a mind game with Manchester United ahead of their Premier clash on Sunday. The Liverpool attacker believed that they need to remind Manchester United that they are the reigning Premier League Champions. The match remained the biggest Liverpool vs Manchester United clash for many years, with Manchester United currently top of the Premier League and three points clear of the champions. Firmino said: “It’s clear that Manchester United are having a great campaign, perhaps their best for many years. But nothing surprises me because it is a great club and this is always a special game. “Right now, you have to say they are our main rival in the title race and that is why we have to beat them and remind them we are champions. “These are the games that any professional wants to play in and the ones you want to win. It would hurt our fans a lot if we lost, I know that is true, but I promise you that nothing other than winning enters our heads.” He added: “This is a special game every year because it is a classic of English football. This time, I agree, it is even more special but only because they are three points ahead of us and if we win then we catch them and continue our fight for the title. “We know it will be a complicated race with a lot of struggles along the way but we still believe we can finish it as champions for the second time in a row and that is what we intend to do.” Post Views:
