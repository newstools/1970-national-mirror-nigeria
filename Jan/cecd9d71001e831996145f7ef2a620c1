BBnaija star Erica has pleaded with her fans to reduce the expectations they have of her if only they truly love her as they claim. Erica in a tweet asked her fans to put themselves in her shoes and reduce the expectations they have of her if they truly love her. According to her, life can really be hard sometimes and when they put themselves in her shoes, they will realize they are expecting more than necessary from her. Some of these fans feel they are entitled to mingle in the life of their favorites and the expectations of the Elites seem to be driving Erica crazy. If you love me, put yourself in my shoes. Reduce the expectations, life can be really hard sometimes. â€” Erica Nlewedim?? (@EricaNlewedim) March 27, 2021
