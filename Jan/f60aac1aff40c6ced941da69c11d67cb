 Trump Supporters Storm US Capitol As Congress Certifies Joe Biden As President-Elect Twitter Reacts To Pro-Trump Protest At US Capitol Large crowds of pro-Trump protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday in a chaotic protest aimed at thwarting a peaceful transfer of power, forcing lawmakers to be rushed from the building and interrupting challenges to Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory. As the protests escalated, Trump first tweeted more criticism of his vice president, Mike Pence, who was presiding over the congressional vote tally, then later urged his supporters to “Stay peaceful!” a request that did not seem to be heeded. It was reported one protester made it into the Senate chamber and shouted “Trump won that election” from the dais, and one person was shot at the Capitol amid the pro-Trump protest Here’s what people are saying on Twitter: America is so much better than what we’re seeing today. — Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) January 6, 2021 A terribly sad day for America, a terribly sad day for leadership. — Tim McGraw (@TheTimMcGraw) January 6, 2021 Here is central contradiction of @realDonaldTrump tweet. He says America is a country of law and order. The election result has been challenged. 62 times in the courts. And no fraud was found. To be a country of laws surely means accepting the verdict of judges who administer it — Jon Sopel (@BBCJonSopel) January 6, 2021 Sure, it dragged in the middle, but the United States of America seems to be having a compelling season finale — Ginny Hogan_ (@ginnyhogan_) January 6, 2021 America needs to tackle its white terrorism problem. — Ben Lee (@benleemusic) January 6, 2021 If you’re unaware of the absolute clusterfuck happening in America right now, our dipshit “patriots” broke onto federal property and their dipshit orange leader praised them. Not even sure what resources I can share to help in this situation, so if you’ve got some, share below. — Brian (@Girbeagly) January 6, 2021 Arrest Trump. Now. His latest remarks are a confession of treason. #CoupAttempt #SeditionHasConsequences — Dr. Deborah Harkness (PhD, LHD) (@DebHarkness) January 6, 2021 Every American has the right to peacefully protest. But storming the US Capitol and attacking the brave men and women of the Capitol police force is wrong. This is not who we are. pic.twitter.com/sRUMJleIEn — Congressman Ken Buck (@RepKenBuck) January 6, 2021 This was the US Capitol during the BLM protests and this is it today. pic.twitter.com/BhpZd6pw8e — Olivia Munn (@oliviamunn) January 6, 2021 An embarrassment in the eyes of the world and total sadness for our country. Wake up America. https://t.co/zWviZStoes — Nikki Haley (@NikkiHaley) January 6, 2021 I saw more arrests during protests in Minneapolis this summer than I have watching people storm the US Capitol. — Omar Jimenez (@OmarJimenez) January 6, 2021 I believe the Republican members of Congress who have incited this domestic terror attack through their attempts to overturn the election must face consequences. They have broken their sacred Oath of Office. I will be introducing a resolution calling for their expulsion. pic.twitter.com/JMTlQ4IfnR — Congresswoman Cori Bush (@RepCori) January 6, 2021 Great. Then tell your Daddy to knock this shit off. You all look so ridiculous at the highest level. It WON'T WORK. YOU LOST. PERIOD! It appears the delusional cultish mindset is running rampant.  IT WON'T CHANGE A THING! what was stolen is the PEACE of America These Last 4 Years https://t.co/e5eRsnFAtT — Shondrella (@Shondrella) January 6, 2021 Black people for America no fit try am.
