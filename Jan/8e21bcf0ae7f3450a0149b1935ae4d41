 Nicolas Sarkozy French ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy has been sentenced to three years in jail, two of them suspended, for corruption. The 66-year-old was found guilty of trying to bribe a magistrate by offering him a prestigious job in return for information about a separate criminal case against Sarkozy. He is the first former French president to receive a custodial sentence. The magistrate and Sarkozyâ€™s former lawyer got similar sentences. All three defendants are expected to appeal. In the ruling, the judge in Paris said Sarkozy could serve a year at home with an electronic tag, rather than go to prison.
