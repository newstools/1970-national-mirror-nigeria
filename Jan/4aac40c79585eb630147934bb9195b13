 Jamie Redknapp believes Super Eagles and Everton versatile player, Alex Iwobi is nowhere near his peak despite churning in good performances at Goodison Park lately. Former Everton manager Marco Silva broke the bank and paid £40m to lure Iwobi to Goodison Park but the Nigerian failed to settled down and soon became surplus to requirements. But Redknapp admitted that the former Arsenal star deserves a pat on the back for rediscovering his form under manager Carlo Ancelotti after he struggled to tie down regularly starting shirt under Marco Silva. He then showered encomium on the youngster after his opening goal against Wolves set the tone for Everton’s 2-1 triumph in the Premier League.  “Iwobi to pop up and score a goal,” said Redknapp. “It hasn’t really happened for him since he has gone to Everton. “But this [goal] will mean so much to him and it will mean so much to the manager. “It shows that you aren’t just reliant on the likes of Calvert-Lewin getting goals,” Redknapp told Skysports Whilst Iwobi is yet to step up his game up to the heights that a Calvert-Lewin has this season, the future looks bright and blinding at Everton than it was when he came to the club. Iwobi came under a barrage of criticism from fans and club legend alike last season after he failed to hit the ground running following his big-money move from Arsenal.  He was later considered for a move away from Goodison Park last summer but Ancelotti opted to give the Nigerian a second chance. It is no big achievement that the Super Eagles midfielder has metamorphosed into one of coach Carlo Ancelotti finished product that has inspired Everton’s performance this season. Post Views:
