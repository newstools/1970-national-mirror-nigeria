 Nigeriaâ€™s exit from recession is a key indicator of the success of the ongoing Economic Sustainability Plan (ESP) approved by the Federal Government, the presidency has said. Laolu Akande, spokesperson for Vice President Yemi Osinbajo , said Nigerians should expect more as the implementation of the plan is gathering greater momentum. Mr. Akande made these claims while updating the media on ESP progress and reacting to the latest GDP figures for the last quarter of 2020. The president and the Federal Executive Council approved the ESP plan last June and the Vice President was asked to lead the implementation of the plan. The plan is aimed, among others, at preventing a deep recession and putting cash in the hands of Nigerians after the economic fallouts of the pandemic. Nigeria slipped out of recession in the last quarter of 2020 as a GDP growth of 0.11 percent was recorded.
