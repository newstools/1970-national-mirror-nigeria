 Southampton meet Arsenal in the FA Cup for the sixth time, and still await their first H2H win in this competition, (D1, L4). Amongst the losses are the 2003 final and a 5-0 thumping at St Mary’s Stadium back in January 2017. Curiously, Southampton’s last FA Cup win over any of London’s Premier League (PL) ever-presents came at the start of their run to the 2003 final. Each of the Saints’ last five regular-time FA Cup eliminations have come against top-flight London opposition, with over 2.5 match goals on four occasions. Three of Southampton’s last four FA Cup tie wins, meanwhile, have produced exactly two second-half goals either way. Arsenal needed extra time to dispatch another top-flight opponent (Newcastle), taking their record from FA Cup games going to extra time (if including penalty shootout results) to: W8, L0 since the start of 2004/05. H2H history underlines the importance of Arsenal making a good start this time, with seven of the Gunners’ nine prior games won/lost at St Mary’s Stadium (W5, D4, L4) seeing the winner on the day lead at HT. Excluding neutral venues, Arsenal have won 11 (lost one) of their last 12 FA Cup away ties – three (W2, L1) of the last five games saw both teams score and combine for over 2.5 total goals. Meanwhile, each of the four wins against PL opposition (at the time) saw Arsenal take the lead inside the opening 25 minutes of play.
