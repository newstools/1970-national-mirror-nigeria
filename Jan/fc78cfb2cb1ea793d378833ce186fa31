 Crystal Palace midfielder, Ebere Eze has received special praise from Manchester City legend Micah Richards following his outstanding debut season in the premier league so far. The England international of Nigerian decent has been a revelation since he joined the Eagles from Queens Park Rangers (QPR) in the summer. Speaking with the BBC Richards said: “What I like about him the most is that he is always looking to pass forward. He can drive forward and plays one-twos. He is just a joy to watch.” Eze was part of the Crystal Palace team that lost 3-0 to 10-man Aston Villa on Saturday and he receieved his first ever caution during that game when he received a yellow card for a foul on Jack Grealish.
