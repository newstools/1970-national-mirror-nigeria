 Ehi Ogbebo Popular Nigerian Interior Décor expert, Ehi Ogbebor has denied claims by some Nigerians that the building of her plush mansion was funded by a man. In a video shared on Instagram, the entrepreneur said she solely funded her house and no one contributed a dime into the construction of her house and has dared anyone who supported her financially to come forward. She said in part, “If you as a man has ever bankrolled Ehi and you don’t talk, God will punish you,” “I built my house myself, that’s hardwork darlings. “I’m on the road, at times 4 days in a week. I do it for myself, I do it for my kids.” “I’ll be the last person, by the grace of God, to date a man for money.”
