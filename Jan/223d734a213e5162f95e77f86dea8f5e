 Ivory defender Serge Aurier has been defended by his Coach Jose Murinho after his calamity show caused Tottenham against Leicester City in the premier league on Sunday. Spurs lost their second consecutive match 2-0 in front of home fans after Aurier gave away a clumsy penalty in the first half before a Toby own goal ensured victory for the visitors. “It was a mistake, not a moment of madness,” he told Sky Sports. “I have to admit, you have to know where you are when you’re in the box. You have to know that the player was going away from goal without any kind of danger. You have to describe it as a mistake. “I know my players’ qualities. Serge was phenomenal against Liverpool – probably our best player – and today, he made this mistake. It’s not fair to say if it cost us the three points. There were other players who showed an attitude that I did not like.” Interestingly, Mourinho had previously been captured on camera during Amazon documentary ‘Spurs All or Nothing’ telling Aurier that he was scared of him giving away a “sh*t penalty with VAR”.
