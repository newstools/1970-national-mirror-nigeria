 Union Berlin forward Taiwo Awoniyi has expressed delight with comparisons with the late iconic Nigerian striker Yekini Rashidi. The Liverpool star who is currently on loan with Urs Fischer’s side, has scored five goals this season with three of the strikes coming in his last three matches. Speaking with Bundesliga.com,Awoniyi revealed: “May his soul rest in peace because, in Nigeria, he’s a great legend. He’s someone that they talk a lot about when it comes to the national team, when it comes to what he has done for the national team. “But for me, I wasn’t born when he was playing, but when I was told about him – by my dad, my friends, even the media – I went to YouTube and I watched him, I watched how he scored his goals. I see it as a privilege, and I see it as a motivation, for me to be compared to such a great player that is gone for now. “The truth about this is, what I always said to people, is I just want to be me, I want to be Taiwo. That’s just my own opinion, with respect to everything he has achieved for the country when he was alive. I just hope he’s in a perfect place now. For me, I just have to keep on working and try to become what I want to become, for myself. That’s what I think about it. “Whenever I’m asked, or whenever I’m told this kind of question – because I’ve been told many, many times! The best you can do is just to work hard, and do more for yourself as a player, and maybe to achieve or try to do what he has done, or try to pass him, who knows? But the most important thing is to stay how you are, keep on working, and keep on being yourself. I believe with that, the future will be better.” Post Views:
