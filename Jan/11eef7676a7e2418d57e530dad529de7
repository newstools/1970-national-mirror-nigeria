 OAP Toke Makinwa has disclosed why she thinks marriage is not rocket science for people to be cracking their brains for as what will work will work and what will scatter will scatter. Toke Makinwa who is divorced has revealed that the earlier people realize that marriage or relationship isn’t rocket science but luck, the better for all as not all relationships or marriages last no matter how hard you try. According to Toke Makinwa, you are blessed and truly lucky if you experience love, commitment, compatibility, and all that in your relationship or marriage as there are no recipes to a successful marriage and no rules to book what works. To Toke Makinwa, what will work will work and what will scatter will scatter hence if you like to read all the books on marriages and cook all the meals, or have all the most explosive sex styles if your marriage wants to scatter it will scatter. Adding that it’s life and its lesson and seasons as some people make a choice to be desirable and spend time working to keep what they have but then end up losing it with the slightest mistake as it wasn’t meant to be in the first place. Toke Makinwa has been married once and we think she’s saying this based on experience and what she has seen around her, therefore, the earlier some people get to understand that marriage is not rocket science but luck the better for them.
