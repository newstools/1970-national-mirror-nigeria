 Super Eagles midfielder Alex Iwobi is hoping for a ‘positive’ 2021 following what he described as a ‘crazy 2020.’ The Nigerian joined Everton at the start of the 2019/2020 season from Arsenal but the campaign was prolonged due to the outbreak of the deadly Coronavirus – which is now into the second wave across countries. Iwobi also joined sports people across the world to preach against racism especially after the death of George Floyd and was equally supportive during the #EndSARS protest in Nigeria. “2020, a crazy history year! Hoping for a positive 2021, stay blessed people,” Iwobi tweeted. On the pitch, Iwobi has been decent for the Toffees and a super regular for Carlo Ancelotti’s side. Iwobi will definitely like to improve on his goals contribution in the New Year as he has scored just a goal in 39 premier league appearances for Everton. Everton lost grounds on top four chase when they were defeated 1-0 by West Ham United on January 1 at Goodison Park.
