 The Game/Mandatory Credit: Photo by MediaPunch Popular American rapper, The Game, has taken to social media to address men about how to stay faithful to one woman. Taking to his Twitter page, he stated that these days, there are beautiful women all over the world, so it is easy to find one and later think that another woman is better than her. The rapper continued by saying that the availability of these women and greed is the reason men keep changing partners until they finally lose them all. Proferring a solution to the problem, The Game stated that once a man finds his wife, he should delete Instagram where there are tons of photos of other beautiful women. He wrote: “There are so many beautiful women in the world, especially these days. Even when you get you a “bad b!tch” soon as you got her, you see another 1 you THINK is badder.. then you gotta have that one & repeat this process until you’ve lost em all one by one. Find yo wife & delete IG.” There are so many beautiful women in the world, especially these days.
