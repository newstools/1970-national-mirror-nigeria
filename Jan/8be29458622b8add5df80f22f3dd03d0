 Real Madrid star Karim Benzema could be included in the France squad for the Euro 2020 as per reports in various journals in France. France manager Didier Deschamps is yet to release the squad for this summer Euro Championship the Real Madrid ace is likely to make the cut. The 33-year-old has been left out by Deschamps after his role in the Mathieu Valbuena saga. Barcelona star dump out for Euro 2020 squad According to the report in L’Equipe and Le Parisien, and confirmed by MARCA, Deschamps has been thinking about the situation for some time and is ready to include Benzema in the squad for Euro 2020, just after the striker was named the best French player playing outside of France. The former Lyon striker has stepped up his game at Real Madrid following the exit of Cristiano Ronaldo, with his performance at club level has indicated he will be included in France’s squad for the European Championship. The fact that the squad size has been increased from 23 players to 26 makes it easier for Deschamps to call up Benzema, as the France coach did not want to break up the squad that won the World Cup in 2018. French Football Federation president Noel Le Graet has done a lot to bring Benzema back, despite their ups and downs over the last six years. Being able to call upon Benzema, who is arguably at the peak of his powers, at a time when the French national team have been struggling is something that neither Le Graet nor Deschamps have been able to ignore.
