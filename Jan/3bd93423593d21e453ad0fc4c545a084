 President Muhammadu Buhari The House of Representatives Committee on Petroleum (Upstream) has given the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) 14 days ultimatum to appear before it. Should the NNPC fail to appear, the committee said, it will summon the Minister of Petroleum, President Muhammadu Buhari. The committee is investigating the revocation and reversal order on the operating licences of OML 123, 124, 126 and 137. The oil assets have been the subject of dispute between Chinese-owned oil companies and the federal government. The dispute led to the revocation and restoration of the mining licenses by the Buhari administration. NNPC, Addax Petroleum Exploration Nigeria Ltd, Kaztech Engineering Ltd, and Salvic Petroleum Resources Ltd were all absent from the committee on Thursday. Timipriye Sylva, the State Minister of Petroleum, and Sarki Auwalu, the Director of the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR), all appeared before the commission. Myrki Adar (APC, Sokoto), the chairman of the committee, issued the ultimatum and expressed readiness to summon the president if the Group Managing Director of the NNPC, Mele Kyari, should fail to appear before the panel. He disclosed that the NNPC sent a letter to the committee that the matter was at the Supreme Court. However, Mr Sylva disputed the claim that the matter was in court. While issuing the ultimatum, Mr Adar said the panel will not hesitate to summon the president, since he is the petroleum minister. “Our message to all those that fail to appear before us as invited namely the NNPC, Addax petroleum company limited, Kaztech engineering ltd and Salvic petroleum resources limited. “We are giving them two weeks from today. We would reschedule this meeting from now to two weeks to appear before this committee and continue our business. “Unless they want us to invite President Muhammadu Buhari as minister of petroleum.
