 Standby Super Eagles invitee Michael Olise has been named in Sky Bet Championship Team of the Week for the second consecutive time. The 19-year-old attacking midfielder was placed on standby by Genort Rohr for the upcoming 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying matches against the Republic of Benin and Lesotho later this month.  Olise inclusion is due to his impressive performance for Reading in last weekend’s 1-1 draw at Nottingham Forest in a 3-5-2 formation.
