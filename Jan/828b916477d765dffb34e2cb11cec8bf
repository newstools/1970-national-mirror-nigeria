 Super Eagles hopeful Tosin Adarabioyo is very happy with a home draw and a clean sheet after Fulham goalless draw against Brighton in the Premier League encounter at Craven Cottage. The 23-year-old Nigerian descent made his eight Premier League appearances of the season since his summer move from dethroned champions Manchester City. Fulham dominated play but wasted a number of goalscoring opportunities in the game with RB Leipzig on loan star Ademola Lookman was denied a penalty in the second-half after a dangerous tackle inside the box by Lewis Dunk. Adarabioyo took his Twitter official handle to happy to see Fulham earn a share of the spoils against Brighton on Wednesday night. Every point is crucial to our fight, but being more clinical is a must! Happy to get a clean sheet and today the hard work continues. @FulhamFC 💪🏾⚽️ pic.twitter.com/zPlzWw1u6n — Tosin Adarabioyo (@TosinAdarabioyo) December 17, 2020 The draw see Fulham climb to 17 places on the log table ahead of the Saturday’s Premier League clash against Southampton at Saint Mary Stadium.
