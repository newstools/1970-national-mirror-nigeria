 Enyimba have crashed out of CAF Champions League despite a 2-1 victory over Al Merrikh on Wednesday evening but lost 4-2 on aggregate. Training 3-0 from the first leg in Omdurman, Fatai Oshoâ€™s side needed an enterprising start to gain a foothold in the tie but started in the worst possible way as they conceded after just seven minutes to a Terry Saif goal. However, Victor Mbaoma level it up nine minutes later for Enyimba before he has put NPFL in front from the spot in the second half. Enyimba will now drop to the CAF Confederation Cup and miss out on $550,000 (253 million Naira). The draw for both the Champions League and Confederation Cup will be staged on Friday. Post Views:
