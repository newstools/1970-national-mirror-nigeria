 Villareal coach Unai Emery has expressed fears that his Nigerian winger Samuel Chukwueze may need to undergo some sort of surgery to address is niggling groin problem. Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday ahead of his side’s La Liga clash against Granada, Emery suggested that surgery may just be the last resort for the Nigeria international. Already, Chukwueze is rated as doubtful for Wednesday’s tie at the Estadio de la Cerámica as he has not been involved in the last training sessions held by the Yellow Submarine due to discomfort. While serving the latest updates concerning the fitness of his squad, Emery told reporters: ” We still have Chukwueze, who has groin discomfort that has been dragging on for a while and we are at a time when the player has stopped. “We are studying the decision of whether to stop for him to have a small operation or to continue playing. Coquelin played normally and Moi is available for tomorrow. The rest is OK”. This season, Chukwueze has featured in 17 matches in the Spanish top-flight, scoring one goal and registering three assists. Post Views:
