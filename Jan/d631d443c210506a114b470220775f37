A video of Baba Ijesha pleading with comedienne Princess after being caught molesting a child left in her care has surfaced the net showing he’s guilty. In the video, Baba Ijesha accepted that what he did is very wrong blaming the devil for that and pleading with comedienne Princess that he’s sorry even though he didn’t give any tangible reason to defend himself. The video shows Baba Ijesha on the floor with his shorts open pleading with comedienne Princess to forgive him for what he did to the child in her care but then was handed over to the police since he wasn’t ready to talk to them. Another video shows they have been able to cancel his bail and will still be in police custody until justice is served as they have now given the police more video to prove that he’s actually guilty and he himself confirmed it in this video going rounds.
