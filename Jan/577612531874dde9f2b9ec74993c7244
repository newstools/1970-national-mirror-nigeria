 The students and staff members, who were taken from a boarding school 10 days ago, have been set free. The news comes just a day after more than 300 girls were kidnapped in Zamfara state. Following a 10-day ordeal, the abducted children, family members and teachers from a school in the north-central Nigerian state of Niger have been released, the state governor said on Saturday. Gunmen freed 42 people, including 27 students, three school staff and 12 members of their families. They were kidnapped last week in the Kagara district of Niger by an armed gang who stormed the Government Science secondary school at around 2 a.m. local time. One boy was killed during the raid. “The Abducted Students, Staff and Relatives of Government Science Collage Kagara, have regained their freedom and have been received by the Niger State Government,” the executive governor of Niger State, Abubakar Sani Bello, said in a tweet.
