 Manchester City will face up with Newcastle on Boxing Day as they look to improve their Premier League fortunes and our partners Betpay brings you a preview and betting tips. Manchester City’s worst start to a Premier League (PL) campaign across the last ten seasons has seen them lament an ordinary win rate of 50% as a home favourite (W3, D2, L1). However they do possess a better home and away PL record of W4, D2 against clubs to start the round in the bottom half of the table, including two HT/FT doubles with margins of at least two goals. Now unbeaten in five PL games, Man City will be looking to immediately follow up an away victory with another three points at home, something they didn’t manage after their two prior PL away wins (D1, L1). What will be concerning is converting just three of their five opening PL goals at home into victory (D1, L1). Newcastle haven’t earned 20 PL points in their first 14 matches since 2014/15, yet after going winless in their last two league matches (D1, L1) they are on the verge of their longest PL winless run of the season, but haven’t lost consecutive PL away fixtures since 2019/20. Interestingly, just one of Newcastle’s six PL road fixtures saw one side lead at the end of both halves, with the team to open the scoring also recording victory just three times (D2, L1). However, Newcastle have earned their above-average unbeaten rate of 66.67% as a travelling outsider (W2, D2, L2) courtesy of recording the game’s final goal four times away from home. Odds Manchester City are odds on favourites to win and are priced at 1.11 odds while Newcastle are priced at a mighty 22.45 and a draw attracts odds of 9.70, all on Betpay.
