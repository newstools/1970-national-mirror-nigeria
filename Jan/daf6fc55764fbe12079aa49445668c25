 Third MainLand Bridge The Oworonshoki-bound lane of the Third Mainland Bridge will be closed totally to vehicular movement by midnight on Saturday, February 6, 2021, till 7. p.m. on Sunday, February 7, for removal of the last expansion joints on the lane. A statement by the Ministry of Transportation explained that the closure is vital to enable the contractors to move their equipment to the lane within the given period without any interruption by vehicular movement on the bridge. Explaining the planned closure, the Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde, stated that the rehabilitation process is being enhanced to ensure that set deadlines are met. Motorists from Ogudu, Alapere and Gbagada are advised to use Ikorodu Road, Jibowu and Yaba as alternative routes, while Iyana Oworonsoki-bound traffic from Lagos Island, Iddo, Oyingbo, Adekunle and Yaba should use Herbert Macaulay Way, Jibowu and Ikorodu Road as alternative routes. The transport commissioner assured that traffic management personnel had been deployed to the affected routes to minimise and address any traffic impediments during the closure. The state government appealed for cooperation by residents as the ongoing repair work on the bridge is for the safety of all and sundry, noting that the Babajide Sanwo-Olu-led administration would not relent in ensuring safety on Lagos roads.
