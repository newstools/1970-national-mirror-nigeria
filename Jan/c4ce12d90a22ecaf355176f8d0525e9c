 Wilfred Ndidi’s Leicester City teammate James Maddison has been dropped as Gareth Southgate names 33-player provisional England squad for Euro 2020 Championships. The 24-year-old English attacking midfielder has been on the fringes of Brenda Rodgers’ side due to an injuries problem but he appeared as a substitute in last weekend’s FA Cup final triumph over Chelsea and featured in the last games two of the season as the King Power outfit miss out in the Champions League for second consecutive years. The England manager has named an initial squad of 33 players before whittling it down to the final 26-man squad closer to the competition but no place for Maddison as Southgate instead opting for Manchester United’s on-loan midfielder Jesse Lingard. The 33-man squad list of the provisional England squad for the European 2020 Championships was revealed via the Three Lions official Twitter handle. Ahead of naming his final #EURO2020 squad next week, Gareth Southgate has selected 33 players to join up with the #ThreeLions from this weekend as our preparations for this summer’s tournament get under way. — England (@England) May 25, 2021 Southgate has called three new players of Brighton defender Ben White, Everton centre-back Ben Godfrey and relegated Sheffield United goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to the squad, while Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold handed a reprieve and a last-ditch chance to make the team for the tournament. Eric Dier is a surprise omission as Southgate has picked him regularly before, while there is no place for Everton’s Michael Keane, Southampton Danny Ings and Newcastle United striker Callum Wilson. With both Harvey Barnes and James Justin ruled out of contention through injury, Leicester City’s only chance of representation was through midfielder Maddison. Southgate has to whittle his final squad down to 26 to submit to UEFA on June 1 but there is the chance to replace anyone who gets injured or falls ill up until 24 hours before their opening game against Croatia.
