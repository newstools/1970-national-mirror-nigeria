 (AP Photo/Nardus Engelbrecht) Sa’ad Abubakar, Sultan of Sokoto, has confirmed the sighting of the moon signalling the beginning of Ramadan. In a live broadcast on Monday, Abubakar announced that the Ramadan fast will begin on Tuesday. He urged Muslims to ensure strict adherence to the COVID protocol during the Ramadan period. “Reliable reports of moon sighting were received from Muslim leaders and organisations across the country, which they duly verified and authenticated before sending to us,” he said. “Consequently, tomorrow, Tuesday, the 13th day of April, 2021, becomes the first day of Ramadan.” The development comes hours after Saudi Arabia announced the sighting of the moon. The Ramadan month is a time for reflection, contemplation, and celebration when Muslims around the world observe fasting for 29 or 30 days. Fasting during the holy month is one of the five pillars of Islam. During the month, Muslim faithful desist from eating, drinking, and any form of sexual relationship from dawn till dusk. They are encouraged to perform prayers, seek forgiveness and engage in humanitarian activities. Fasting in Ramadan is made compulsory for all adult Muslims, except an individual is sick, travelling, observing menstrual cycle, pregnant, or elderly. The Islamic calendar follows the phases of the moon, known as the lunar cycle, falling nearly 10 days earlier every year in the Gregorian calendar.
