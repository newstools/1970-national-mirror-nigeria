 Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has defended the club’s unwanted stats after he was questioned about his team performance against the Premier League top sides. Chelsea suffered poor results against the likes of Liverpool, Tottenham, Manchester United and Everton this term. Lampard feels unperturbed about it, “I read about that stat a lot [not beating a top ten side] and I think this year has shown that the balance of the Premier League has changed,” Lampard told Sky Sports. Chelsea set to sell seven players to fund a move for Real Madrid target REVEALED: The reason why ex-Chelsea star was left out against Granada Timo Werner fires blank in Chelsea 3-0 win over West Ham “Anybody can beat anybody, whether you’re at the top or the bottom. “Leeds were in the bottom half when we played them, and that was a really tough match. They’ve given some big teams some really tough matches. “I think it’s a bit of a red herring as a stat to look at games against the top half compared to the bottom half of the table.” Chelsea is 5th on the Premier League table and they are six points behind the league leader Liverpool the Blues play Arsenal on Boxing day at the Emirate Stadium.
