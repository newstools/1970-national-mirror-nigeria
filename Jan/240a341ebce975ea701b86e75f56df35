 Bobi Wine The incumbent President of Uganda reportedly ordered a total shutdown of the internet prior to the presidential elections on 14 January 2020. The Communication Commission also ordered the telecommunication networks to shut down all social media applications to prevent the sharing of information. This has affected the transparency and eligibility of the 2020 elections.
This development led to blockage of Bobi Wines phone and also access to internet
In a tweet, he said Like my wife’s, my phone has been blocked and I am unable to recieve or make regular calls. I know this is to stop me from communicating to our agents and coordinators. I encourage you comrades to be vigilant as I try to devise ways of reaching out to you. Like my wife's, my phone has been blocked and I am unable to recieve or make regular calls.
