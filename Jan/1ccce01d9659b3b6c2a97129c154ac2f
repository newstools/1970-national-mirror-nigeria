 Nigeria’s Golden Eaglet beat Burkina Faso 1-0 to reach the final of the ongoing West African Football Union (WAFU) B Tournament in Lome, Togo and also qualified for the U17 Africa Cup of Nation in Morocco later in the year. Nigeria went through to the last four on a better goals difference than arch-rivals Ghana to set up a Titanic semifinal battle against Burkina Faso U 17. After a first-half goalless draw with Michael Emmanuel Papo puts Nigeria ahead 13th minutes from time after a brilliant finish. Burkina Faso young guns try to push for an equaliser with no avail as the Coach Fatai Amoo’s boys held unto the victory and seal the passage to final and automatic qualification to the U17 AFCON in Morocco. Their last triumph was achieved at the 2015 edition when they silenced Mali 2-0 in the final thanks to second-half strikes from Victor Osimhen and Funsho Bamgboye. Post Views:
