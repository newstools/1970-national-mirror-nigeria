 Fikayo Tomori has expressed great joy after completing his move to AC Milan and revealed his surreal experience after talking to club legend Paolo Maldini. The 23-year-old who signed for the Serie A side on loan for the rest of the season with an option to buy for £25m made just four appearances for Chelsea and all were in the EFL Cup. ‘It’s a club with great history, this is an opportunity I couldn’t turn down,’ Tomori told Milan’s official website. ‘I was surprised, when I spoke to Paolo Maldini, the best defender who has ever played football, I knew this was where I wanted to be and where I wanted to play football. I am very happy to be here now.’ Tomori who snubbed Nigeria for England is expected to help ease AC Milan’s defensive crisis with Alessio Romagnoli suspended while Simon Kjaer and Matteo Gabbia are in the treatment room.
