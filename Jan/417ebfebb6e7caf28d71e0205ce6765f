 Erling Haaland has been advised to stay at Borussia Dortmund and become a world class player before seeking a move elsewhere, according to club CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke. The Norwagien and former Manchester City winger Jadon Sancho have been linked with moves away from the Bundesliga club. However, Watzke believes that the 20-year-old forward would be wise to stay at Signal Iduna Park just like Robert Lewandowski did before moving on to Bayern München in 2014. “I don’t think that will happen. Erling and his agent, Mino Raiola, know what they have in us. I can only advise him to do as Robert Lewandowski did. Back then, he gave himself the time to mature into an absolute world-class player at Dortmund,” Watzke told Kicker and added: “You can’t do that in just one year. And it’s clear that if Erling were to leave us at some point, he’d only go to an even bigger club. And there aren’t that many to consider. If you got to a club like – just to give an example – Real Madrid, you need to be a world-class player.” Haaland joined Dortmund from RB Salzburg just a year ago.
