Obaseki said, “As we begin a New year under difficult circumstances, we must realize that tough times don’t last forever. Let us see the opportunities in this adversity and continue to preach love and hope this new year. “Please remember that COVID-19 is still here with us and we must follow all the precautionary public health and safety guidelines.” On the steps being taken to fortify the health sector to respond to public health challenges in the state, he said, “One major lesson from the COVID-19 pandemic is that we must strengthen our healthcare system. “We have therefore begun our comprehensive healthcare reforms which will include rebuilding the schools to train healthcare manpower, fully rolling out the state’s health insurance scheme to provide a source for financing our health systems and increasing the number of state-of-the-art healthcare centres in the state from the current 61 to 120 this year, 2021.” Vanguard News Nigeria
