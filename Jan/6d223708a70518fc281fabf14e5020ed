 Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho has lashed out furiously at England midfielder Dele Alli for creating problems for teammates during their 3-1 win at Stoke in the Carabao Cup quarter-final. Goals from Real Madrid loanee Gareth Bale, Ben Davies and Harry Kane helped Spurs crush the Championship club Jordan Thompson scoring the consolation goal for the visitors. “Yes, for me a player that plays in that position is a player that has to link and create and not to create problems for his own team,” Mourinho said. “In that situation, an objective counter-attack would probably end with a goal, and it ended with a counter-attack behind our defenders. “We were unbalanced because when you are in possession you have full-backs out wide and another midfielder in a different line and they caught us in a counter-attack and they transformed the result of the game that was totally in our hands, so yes I am upset.”
