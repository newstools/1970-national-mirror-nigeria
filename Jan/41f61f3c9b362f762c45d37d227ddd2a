 Head Coach of Wikki Tourist, Usman Abdallah says his team could have scored more against Rivers United despite their 1-0 win during the Match-Day 4 of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Chinedu Udeagha, scored the winner from a well taken free kick in the 29th minute of the match to hand his side the precious win. Speaking after the encounter, Head Coach of Wikki Tourist Usman Abdallah said: ‘We won the game in the first half. I expected a lot of goals maybe two or three in the first half but unfortunately we missed some chances and we didn’t get too much of the ball in their eighteen yard box. ‘So we tried to do that in the second half which we did but we squadered a few chances there but its football, that’s how it is. We are lucky we got that first goal and we bagged in the three points. We are happy with that.’ On his part, Rivers United Technical Adviser Stanley Eguma said: “After the game we played on Sunday, we had a terrible moment travelling to Bauchi. We had a hectic period because fatigue was very very instrumental to our lose today.” “Maybe because of the breakdown we had on the road on our way coming. But I think that the players tried their best.  We have lost today but we still have other games to play. We are going to correct our mistakes and work on the fatigue issue.” Post Views:
