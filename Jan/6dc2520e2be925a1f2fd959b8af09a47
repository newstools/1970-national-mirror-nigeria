 Paul Onuachu did it again as Super Eagles hammered Lesotho 3-0 in the Group L final dead-rubber encounter in the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier at the Teslim Balogun Stadium on Tuesday night. Gernot Rohr made four changes from last Saturday victory with Francis Uzoho, Alex Iwobi, Tyronne Ebuehi and Oghenekaro Etebo all returning the starting eleven to replace Maduka Okoye, Ola Aina, Joe Aribo and Henry Onyekuru. Victor Osimhen opened the scoring for three-time African Champions in the 23rd minutes before Oghenekaro Etebo and Onuachu helped the three-time African champions end their Group L campaign with an unbeaten record of six games. Genk goalpocher did it again after coming from the substitue bench to notched his third goal for Super Eagles after Henry Onyekuru provides the assistÂ seven minutes from time. Nigeria thus finished top of Group L with 14 points from six matches. Benin and Sierra Leone will later today battle for the other ticket to Cameroon from this group, while Lesotho finished bottom of the standings on three points. . Post Views:
