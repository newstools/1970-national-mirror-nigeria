 Chelsea on loan Super Eagles targets Ike Ugbo on the radar of Fulham, Watford, Genk, Schalke and Sassuolo. The 22-year-old Nigerian descent had an impressive season on loan with Cercle Brugge from Premier League giants Chelsea but his 17 goals in Belgium Jupiler this season helped them avoid relegation from the Belgian top-flight. According to reports Football Insider claimed that Fulham have joined Watford, Genk, Schalke and Sassuolo in the services of Ugbo this summer. English-born forward still has one year remaining on his current deal with Champions League finalist Chelsea but the young striker has not played a single minute of Premier League football in his career, and he could relish getting the opportunity next season. Ugbo has chosen to pledge his international future to Nigeria and is going through the correct FIFA procedures to gain clearance despite featuring for the Young Lions. Post Views:
