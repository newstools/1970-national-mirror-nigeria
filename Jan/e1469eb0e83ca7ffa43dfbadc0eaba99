Oyelowo plays Amos, father to Gunner, a young boy who embarks on a journey with a local misfit Jo to try and save his ill mother.

Thank you to them, my beautiful cast and amazing crew. @shivhanspics @yorubasaxon”, the actor wrote, sharing the good news on Instagram. The family-centred drama was written by Emma Needell and stars Rosario Dawson, Lonnie Chavis, Amiah Miller, Maria Bello and Alfred Molina. Ric Hassani will be providing original music for the feature film. Talking about the film, David Oyelowo told People: It’s a story about love and the things we’re prepared to do for love. I was just so touched by the idea of a son wanting to do everything he can to save his mother. The film is also very akin to the kind of films I loved growing up, the kind of films Steven Spielberg made, or films like The Goonies and Gremlins and Stand By Me. David Oyelowo and the cast had a conversation with TIFF in advance of “The Water Man” premiere at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival. Photo Credit: davidoyelowo
