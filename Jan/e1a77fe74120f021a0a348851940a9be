 Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen was again benched in his second match back since his return from injury and Covid-19 as Napoli host giant-killers Spezia in the Coppa Italia quarter finals. The 21-year-old returned to action after three months absence at the weekend but could not inspire Generro Gattuso’s men to a win as they were hammered 3-1 against Verona in a Serie A fixture. Osimhen and Dries Mertens are back from injury but not fit enough to start the encounter. However, Napoli are rated favourites and the winner inside the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona will go on to face Atalanta in the two-legged semi-final. Osimhen will be desperate to score and help Napoli beat Spezia as he has only scored twice since his big money move from Ligue 1 Lille. Napoli: Ospina; Hysaj, Manolas, Koulibaly, Mario Rui; Elmas, Demme, Zielinski; Politano, Lozano, Insigne. Spezia: Krapikas; Vignali, Ismajli, Terzi, Dell’Orco; Estevez, Ricci, Acampora; Gyasi, Galabinov, Verde. Post Views:
