 Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi have won their first FA Cup title with Leicester City after beating Chelsea 1-0 in the final of the competition. The Foxes’ long wait for an FA Cup trophy came to an end on Saturday, May 15, after a screamer from Youri Tielemans proved unstoppable for Chelsea’s goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and eventually became the match winner. The Super Eagles duo played key roles as Brendan Rodgers’ side claimed the coveted title at Wembley Stadium. Nigerians including former Arsenal star Nwankwo Kanu have taken to social media to celebrate Kelechi Iheanacho and Wilfred Ndidi after their FA Cup triumph with Leicester City. The Foxes defeated Premier League rivals Chelsea 1-0 on Saturday, thanks to Youri Tielemans’ 63rd-minute strike. Iheanacho was in action for 67 minutes while Ndidi was solid in the middle of the park for the entire duration.
