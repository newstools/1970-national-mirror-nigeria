 Pope Francis and his Personal Doctor Fabrizio Soccorsi Pope Francis’ personal doctor, Fabrizio Soccorsi, has died from health complications related to the coronavirus, according to the Vatican. The 78-year-old physician, who was undergoing an “oncological pathology,”treatment  died at Rome’s Gemelli Hospital, according to reports. Pope Francis named Soccorsi his personal physician in August 2015, after not renewing the term of papal doctor Patrizio Polisca, who was also head of the Vatican’s healthcare services. Since the pontificate of St. Pope John Paul II, the two positions had been tied together, but Pope Francis diverged from this custom by choosing Soccorsi, a doctor from outside the Vatican.
