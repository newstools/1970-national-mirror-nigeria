 Tammy Abraham scored a hattrick against Luton in the FA Cup as Chelsea booked their place in the next round of the competition. Chelsea was off to a flying start with Abraham scoring two goals in the 17 minutes of action against Luton in the FA Cup and in the 75th minute he completed his hat-trick against Luton. The Blues attacker was at the right place at the right time to pounce on a loose ball inside the box to beat with a shot into the net in the 11th minute. The England international responded again with a simple tap from a close range after the cross from Reece James evaded the goalkeeper in the 17th minute. Luton responded with a goal from a great play after Jordon Clark connected with a defence-splitting pass to give the visitor a lifeline and made it 2-1 in the 30th minute. Abraham was at again after he showed great composure inside the box and put the ball inside the next to complete a hattrick against the lower division side to make it 3-1. Chelsea had the chance to make it four but Timo Wernerâ€™s penalty was saved by Luton goalkeeper Simon Sluga. Post Views:
