 Rapper and Fashion Mogul Kanye West is officially worth a whopping $6.6 billion USD, making him the richest Black man in America’s history. Around the same time last year, West became a certified billionaire with the help of his successful apparel and sneaker brand, Yeezy and new multi-year contract with Gap. According to Business of Fashion, the Yeezy brand is valued at $3.2 to $4.7 billion USD. As for the new Yeezy Gap line which is set to release later this summer, the new venture is expected to be worth more than $970 million USD. Since West remains the sole owner of the Yeezy company, much of his personal net worth is attributed to his recent business decisions and the $1.7 billion USD that he pockets from additional assets, including his significant investment into his soon-to-be ex-wife’s Skims label. An unaudited balance sheet of West’s finances has also revealed that West has $122 million USD in cash and stock, while his entire music catalog is worth $110.5 million USD.
