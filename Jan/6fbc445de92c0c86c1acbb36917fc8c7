 Nigeria’s Golden Eaglets on Wednesday lost 1-0 to Cote d’Ivoire in their opening game at the ongoing West African Football Union (WAFU) B Tournament in Lome, Togo. The Ivorians got what turned to be their winning goal in the 76th minute of Wednesday’s encounter. With Group B having only three teams and each team to play only two matches, the chances of the Eaglets progressing has been made more difficult with the opening day loss. Having started with a loss in Lome, the Golden Eaglets are condemned to win their other Group game against arch-rivals Ghana on Saturday. Both Nigeria and Ghana have seven cadet world titles between them, and clashes between them at any level usually have an extra edge. At the moment, the goal for the Golden Eaglets is to qualify for this year’s CAF U17 Cup of Nations taking place in the North African kingdom of Morocco. Already, FIFA has announced that the U-17 and U-20 World Cups will not hold this year as earlier scheduled. Post Views:
