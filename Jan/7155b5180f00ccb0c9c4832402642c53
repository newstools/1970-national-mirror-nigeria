 NFF and FIFA remember Super Eagles legend Rashidi Yekini who died on this day nine years ago May 4 2012. The Kaduna-born scored a remarkable 37 goals in 58 appearances in Nigeria after represented three-time Africa Champions in three Afcon and two FIFA World Cups where he scored the country’s first-ever goal in the competition.

Amunike (1994), Nwankwo Kanu (1996 and 1999) and Victor Ikpeba (1997) claimed the coveted award in the 90s, while Okocha ended runner-up in ’98.
