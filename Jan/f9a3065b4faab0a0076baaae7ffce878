 La Liga reacts after Samuel Chukwueze scores twice in Villarreal 4-1 win away to local rivals Levante at the Estadio Ciudad de Valencia in a La Liga clash on Sunday night. The 21-year-old Nigeria international ended his 15-game goal drought in the league after hitting the back of the net twice in the encounter. Chukwueze first braces in the league and also first in Spanish football as La Liga took their Twiter handle to react.
