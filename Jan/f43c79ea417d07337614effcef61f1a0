 Super Eagles winger Henry Onyekuru has revealed his excitement after returning to Galatasaray on loan. The Nigerian who helped the club win the 2018-19 Turkish Super Lig title was assigned the number 7 jersey following his unveiling on Tuesday. “Honestly, I’m very happy to be back in Galatasaray where I had previously enjoyed success,” Onyekuru told BBC Sport Africa. “I chose Galatasaray because I’ve not been playing for six months. I just want to go somewhere that I don’t need to try too hard to prove anything to the coach or force myself into the consciousness of the club or fans. “Here at this historical club, I can get more regular games to be back in shape. Play on a weekly basis to get my form and important fitness back.” Post Views:
