 The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday said it had yet to adopt any position on zoning ahead of the 2023 presidential elections. The party made the clarification in a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Mr Kola Ologbondiyan, in Abuja. Ologbondiyan said that the party had yet to take any decision on any of the recommendations proposed by the Sen. Bala Mohammed-led PDP Committee on the Review of the 2019 elections. He said that the PDP immensely appreciated the overwhelming interest by majority of Nigerians in the  party. “Our party notes that such unprecedented public interest and confidence in the PDP is responsible for the widespread discussions and enquiries on the recommendations of the Committee on the Review of the 2019 Elections. “The PDP notes that the recommendations will be subjected to its democratic process by relevant organs of the party and consultation across all national interests. “While our party appreciates the enthusiasm by Nigerians on our nomination processes, the PDP assures that its decision on zoning will be the product of wide consultation, discussions and consensus building, taking into consideration the aggregate aspiration and hope of the generality of the Nigerian people. “Our party has however noted the disposition and line of discussion from various political interests across the six geo-political zones of our country in this regard, and at the appropriate time, the collective understanding of Nigerians will prevail.” Vanguard News Nigeria
