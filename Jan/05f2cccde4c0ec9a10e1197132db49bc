Hip-hop artist Quavo spoke up after his girlfriend, Saweetie, from whom he split, announced their breakup and revealed that she is single again. According to Saweetie she is single and “have endured too much betrayal and hurt behind the scenes for a false narrative to be circulating that degrades my character. Presents don’t band aid scars and the love isn’t real when the intimacy is given to other women.” “I emotionally checked out a long time ago and have walked away with a deep sense of peace and freedom,” she added in a second tweet. “Excited for this new chapter of elevation,”she tweeted. Following Saweetie’s tweet, Quavo shared his own tweets, saying that he had love for her but she isn’t the woman he thought she was. “I know you want to make this into a show so I’ll play my part just this one time. I don’t normally put my business out there, especially my personal life. I feel the need to address this so there are no false narratives,” he wrote. I had love for you and disappointed you did all that. You are not the woman I thought you were.  I wish you nothing but the best ??. — QuavoYRN (@QuavoStuntin) March 19, 2021
