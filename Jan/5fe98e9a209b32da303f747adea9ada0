(Photo by Mark Brake/Getty Images) American electric vehicle company, Tesla, Inc has become the first automaker to acquire bitcoins worth $1.5billion for “more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash.” Tesla revealed in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that a planned share of its assets may be invested in digital assets and that payments for its products will be made in bitcoin on a limited basis and “subject to applicable laws”.  This move will give Tesla liquidity in the cryptocurrency once it starts accepting it for payments. The move by Tesla, coupled with earlier moves like Tesla CEO Elon Musk adding “#bitcoin” to his Twitter bio and sharing tweets that have led more people to purchase bitcoins, has caused the prices of bitcoin to skyrocket to at least $44,200 and making As the world marvels at Tesla’s big move, Nigerians wonder what the next move for the country will be, as the Central Bank of Nigeria recently placed a ban on the exchange of cryptocurrencies in Nigeria. While Nigeria bans cryptocurrencies, Tesla buys bitcoin. Economics is not rocket science. — Bhadoosky (@BhadmusAkeem) February 8, 2021 The Nigerian government bans cryptocurrency.

Thank you Elon #Bitcoin 🚀 — 𝓜 (@MichellePhan) February 8, 2021 February 8, 2021: A watershed moment for BTC. The day that Tesla announced it's holding reserves in BTC and the day that stock to flow inventor @100trillionUSD quit his job to focus full time on BTC. I think these events may be correlated: the next phase of S2F is now confirmed. — Marc van der Chijs (@marcvanderchijs) February 8, 2021 1. Add btc to balance sheet2. Accept btc for tesla3. Tesla becomes best selling car4. Tesla stock to the OORT cloud4. Btc accepted as payment everywhere5. Regulatory shifts on treatment of btc@elonmusk said mainstream adoption is here.
