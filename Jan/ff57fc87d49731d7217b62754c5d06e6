 Abuja-based photographer George Okoro turned 35 today, Thursday the 13th of May 2021. He celebrated the day with an elegant photoshoot and we absolutely love everything about it. He has accomplished a great deal in his career, including taking family portraits for the Buharis and photographing many of the Northâ€™s best weddings, which have been featured on BellaNaija Weddings.
