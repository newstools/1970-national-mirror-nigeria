 Award-winning Nigerian Creative Artist and Filmmaker, Ifan Michael is known for his work as a celebrity fashion stylist and executive producer of “Lotanna” has been included in Forbes Africa’s annual 30 Under 30 list. The “Foreigner’s God” film director, producer, and costume designer made the seventh edition of the Forbes list featuring Africans under the age of 30 who are innovative entrepreneurs, tech geeks, sports stars, and influential creatives leading a pandemic-hit Africa. The list includes Nigerian singer Rema, South African artiste Master KG, Amarachi Nwosu, and others. Ifan, a self-taught creative and filmmaker reacted on his Instagram saying “to be living this reality feels significantly different for me; this common 10-year-old boy who didn’t have the luxury to have a formal education, slept under bridges, and begged on the streets of Lagos” and that he is “immensely proud and grateful to have made the Forbes 30 Under 30 class of 2021.” In recent times, Ifan has featured in two global platforms such as GQ Magazine’s Young, Gifted and Black series and Glamour Magazine’s Made in Africa series. His inclusion in the Forbes Africa 30 Under 30 list undoubtedly positions him on the course to take the film industry by storm. Ifan is currently developing a slate of trendsetting human interest African stories with an eye for the highest quality to help boost the Nigerian film industry standard globally. We can’t wait to see what he has up his creative sleeves next.
