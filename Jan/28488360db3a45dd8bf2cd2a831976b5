 Spanish manager Luis Enrique has announced the Spanish squad for Euro 2020 and the gaffer was not moved to leave out some high profile stars from the La Furia Roja team.  SERGIO RAMOS
The major absentee from the squad is Sergio Ramos, the Real Madrid captain struggle with fitness issues due to injuries, the central defender only played five games for the Los Blancos this season due to injury and won’t be participating in the Euros for Spain.  NACHO 
The omission of Nacho’s name from the squad is hard to explain, he was Real Madrid mainstay at the defence along with Eder Militao following the absence of Ramos and Raphael Varane. Even with the omission from Enrique’s team, he has opted up his profile in Real Madrid and he would be counted on again and again.  INIGO MARTINEZ:
The centre defender lowers his guard at the wrong time of the season, he suffers a dip of form towards the end of the season.
The Athletic Bilbao, the Basque team ended the season poorly, the likes of Cesar Azpilicueta and Pau Torres were included instead.  JESUS NAVAS:
The experienced winger was overlooked by the squad the likes of Adama Traore will step up in his absence.  SERGIO CANALES:
The Real Betis playmaker displayed a superb form in the just-concluded season and regularly featured for Spain in the previous games but injuries limited his involvement in the Real Betis team towards the end of the season and his form was greatly affected.  IAGO ASPAS:
The Galician attacker was left out, this came as a shock to most Spanish fans. Spain is not so blessed with numerous attackers and the decision to leave out an experienced player like Aspas does not sink well.
Aspas scored 14 times, which almost guided Celta Vigo to Europa League.  MIKEL MERINO:
The Real Sociedad midfielder was dropped after struggling so much with injuries, he was short of time to recover from the injuries he sustained. Post Views:
