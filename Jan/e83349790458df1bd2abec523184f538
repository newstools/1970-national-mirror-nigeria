 Nigeria’s leading telecommunications service provider, Globacom, has commended workers in Nigeria for their diligence and resilience despite daunting odds against them. The network in its statement commemorating 2021 International Workers’ Day stated, “Nigerian workers deserve commendation for their unrivalled dedication to the economy, which has significantly aided the country’s stability and development.” Globacom stressed that a vibrant workforce creates a prosperous economy. “The progress that Nigeria has recorded in different sectors of the economy, including telecoms, would not have been possible without the sacrifice, commitment and resourcefulness of the country’s workers. They remain the pillar of Nigeria’s economy.” The company urged labour unions in the country to encourage their members to build a stronger work culture that will engender more efficiency, reliability and productivity. It explained that this will further enhance the prevalence of world-class labour standards in Nigeria. May Day is a national public holiday in many countries worldwide and is set aside for the celebration of the international labour movements annually.
