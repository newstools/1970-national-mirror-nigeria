 Timo Werner concedes he is struggling to adapt to the demands of English football which is “tougher than he thought”. The Chelsea forward is without a goal in his last eight games as the Blues prepare for a London derby against West Ham. Werner’s 34-goal season at RB Leipzig last term convinced the west Londoners to spend £47.5m on acquiring his services. But the condensed fixture schedule has made the German’s settling in period that much harder. Werner has highlighted the challenges that come with playing in midweek, something not all top flight clubs have to contend with. “It does matter how much you cost. It’s always a bit of pressure when you come to a new club,” Werner told Chelsea’s official website. “But I think I can handle it very well. It’s not something new. “The pressure is a little bit higher than the previous years but I think good footballers are the best under pressure and that’s my plan, I can do very well under pressure. “The Premier League is a little bit different to my old league. It’s tougher than I thought. “The contact here is harder than in Germany, it’s what I expected but not like this. “The beginning was very good, but now after a lot of games I’m struggling a little. I think it’s hard when you play every three days… and on Saturday against teams that can rest the whole week.”
