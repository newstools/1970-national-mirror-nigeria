I am really excited about this remix with Kamo Mphela, Mpura & SayFar because it’s a great blend of South African & Nigerian music. Like the first song with Niniola, this is sure to keep you on your feet. Kamo Mphela & Mpura were the best people to complement the song giving it that full amapiano sound because of their distinct voices.” As for Amapiano hitmaker, Kamo Mphela, her rise to the top in South Africa has been unmissable and is sure to add her infectious energy to “Squander”. Her passion for dance motivated her choreographed moves, shaking the industry and trailblazing her career, coupled with her timeless collaborations with the likes of Busiswa and DJ Maphorisa. Her credentials for hit songs are evident having contributed to several smash hits over the last two years, including “Sandton” and “Amanikiniki.” Produced by Nigerian hitmaker Willis and South African rising star dance artist and producer, SayFar, “Squander” (remix) is an infectious song that would keep you dancing.
