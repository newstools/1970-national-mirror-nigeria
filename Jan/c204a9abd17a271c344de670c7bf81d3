 As the COVID-19 cases in Nigeria drop, there has been the need to shut down some of the isolation and treatment centres. As we speak, about seven treatment centres in Lagos and Abuja have been shut down. This was contained in a report by the PUNCH. The report stated that the National Hospital had discharged its last patient while the University of Abuja Teaching Hospital, Gwagwalada had about four patients. The Chief Medical Director, UATH, Prof Bishop Ekele confirmed this development saying; “We thank God that things (cases) are beginning to drop. The doctors’ strike has no effect on our facility. Usually, it is those that need oxygen that are brought to us. We have just about four patients and hopefully, they might soon be discharged.” The spokesperson for the National Hospital, Dr. Tayo Haastrup also reacted to the development as he said; “We have no more (coronavirus) patients in our isolation centre. However, we will not be closing it down because that is what we use for epidemics like Lassa fever. We still have the six rooms for such purposes.” Additionally, the Minister of State for Health, Dr Olorunnimbe Mamora also indicated that the decline in the daily infection currently suggests that the strategies used by the government were really working. He said; “It shows that our strategies are working. If the rate of infection is dropping, it shows we are doing something right.”
