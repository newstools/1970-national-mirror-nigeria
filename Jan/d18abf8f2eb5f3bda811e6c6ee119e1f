 Kanye West A Kanye West documentary is coming to Netflix after the streaming service acquired it for upwards of $30 million. The multi-part project, which will feature never-before-seen archival footage of Ye and material 21 years in-the-making, comes from Clarence “Coodie” Simmons and Chike Ozah, the duo known as Coodie and Chike. They co-directed Ye’s 2003 “Through the Wire” video and the third version of “Jesus Walks.” The project, which does not yet have a title, is reportedly set to debut on Netflix later this year. The directing duo has previously directed ESPN’s 2012 30-for-30 film, Benji, and Netflix’s 2019 documentary on Stephon Marbury, A Kid From Coney Island. Their company, Creative Control, will reportedly produce the Yeezy doc alongside TIME Studios. Simmons has been filming Ye since his early days in Chicago in the late ‘90s. His relationship with Kanye will reportedly drive the series, and the filmmakers will touch on Ye’s early rise, the death of his mother, Donda West, his fashion work, and his 2020 presidential run. A source tells Billboard that Ye has essentially given the duo his blessing by allowing himself to be filmed for 21 years.
