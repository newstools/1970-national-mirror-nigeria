 Bola Tinubu has noted that from 2017 to 2018, the leadership of Lagos was directed in the wrong direction. This comments attributes to when Akinwumi Ambode was governor of Lagos State from 2015 to 2019. On Friday, March 5, speaking at the inauguration of the Agege Pen-Cinema Bridge, the national leader of the APC stated that the Governor Sanwo-Olu and his entire cabinet have shown unequal determination to redevelop Lagos. He said; “Sometimes in 2017-2018, the ship of this state seems to have headed in a very wrong direction. Ever since Babajide became the captain of the ship of our state, he has turned it round to the right direction of progress, development, and good leadership quality. “Both of you (Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat) and the entire cabinet have demonstrated unequal determination to redevelop, rebuild for the people of Lagos. You have made us seen a fine and determined government for the progress and quality of life of our people.” Bola Tinubu went further to urge the youth to abscond from thuggery. He advised that destruction and disruptioni will not help receive the destination they desire while noting that development only comes with peace. He added; “Don’t copy vagabonds and those who are into thuggery. There is no development if there is no peace. We must encourage peace. The government will ensure that you get the right education. Education is an investment in your future. “Destruction and disruption will not help you to reach the destination you desire to reach. We will support your aspirations but help the state, ensure peace in our state and country. “Despite the turbulence and crisis of the virus, the lockdown, you are able to continue to deliver this state. You have shown great determination as a government.”
