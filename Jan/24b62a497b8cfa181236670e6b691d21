She posted on her Insta story that she was going to commit Suicide and her family should not mourn her cause they never cared. Her Uncle, Ozolua Giwa-AmuÂ took to Facebook to affirm her death in a post, he worte; Thank you all,
On behalf of the SIO Giwa-Amu family and specifically the Obafemi Ehimigbai Giwa-Amu (my elder brother), family of Evbiobe (Sabongida-Ora) Edo State, I state the following:
It is with the utmost regret it falls on me to announce, that our most beautiful daughter, Ohirenua Giwa-Amu, youngest daughter of Femi and Ngozi, passed away last night. This is a most heartbreaking day for us all.
On behalf of her parents, my mother, brothers, sisters, and the whole family I ask that you kindly say a prayer, light a candle, sing a worship song, for our little girl, that she may find eternal rest. Renua was a beautiful soul, may the Almighty have mercy upon her and receive her soul.
Renua, with so much pain, pls know, we will love you forever!!!
I thank you all.
