I’m focused right now on developing as a driver and racer, so having McLaren by my side can only help me on and off the track An excited Oluchi also shared the news on Instagram with the caption, “Thank you, GOD! Angels in the heavenlies Thank you. Watch over your Son. @ugougochukwu It’s beyond us 🙏🏾”.

Now we’ll focus on giving Ugo the right support when he needs it to help him fulfil his potential. “Ugo is a promising young talent with strong development prospects. While he is still early in his career, it is clear he has the ingredients to be successful in the sport. This signing reflects our refocused approach to identifying and supporting new talent, away from a formal young driver programme to a more tailored basis,” Andreas Seidl, Team Principal, McLaren F1 added.
