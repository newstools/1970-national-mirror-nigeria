 It’s just one win across the last six Premier League (PL) matches for Leeds United (W1, D1, L4) who’ve slumped to 14th in the table ahead of this midweek round. Notably, in four of the last five matches where they won points (W3, D2) they kept a clean sheet, while they’ve racked up a whopping 13 conceded goals across their last four defeats (3.25 on average). A big problem so far for Leeds has been their home form, as three of their four wins this season have come on the road, and they’ve not won in five PL matches here (D2, L3). They’ve scored just 0.6 goals per match across those five fixtures – which is less than the 0.8 they’ve conceded across the first halves alone (1.6 in total)! Newcastle, meanwhile, won their second consecutive PL match last time out – the first time they’ve achieved that since June. It was their third win across their last five games in the league (L2), and their fourth win from five PL victories this season in which they scored precisely two goals. Indeed, the winning side on the day has scored precisely two goals in five straight PL matches involving Newcastle. Away from home, the ‘Magpies’ have folded their wings and are the only PL team yet to be involved in a match featuring over 2.5 goals (W2, D2, L1). They’re also yet to score a first-half goal away from home this PL season.
