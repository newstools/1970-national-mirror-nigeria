 Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi will join Paris Saint Germain in the summer, according to Omar da Fonseca. PSG are open about their pursuit of the Argentine who failed to join Manchester City last summer due to disagreement with the Catalan giants’ board. Mauricio Pochettino, who arrived the Parc des Princes this season is a massive fan of Messi and he is open to the 6-time Ballon D’Or winner reuniting with Brazilian Neymar and forming a deadly front three with Mbappe. “In the Spanish newspapers I read that his whole family had begun to learn French,” Da Fonseca – a retired Argentine footballer who played for PSG during his career – explained in an interview with RMC. “As a child, if I’d been told I was coming to play in Paris then it would have been music to my ears. For us Argentines in France, Paris is something important. “Messi will come. Just imagine if he is able to say he won the Champions League with PSG.” PSG are firmly obsessed about winning the UEFA Champions League and believe Messi could help them achieve that feat next season.
