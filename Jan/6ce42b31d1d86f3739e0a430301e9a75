The farmers who accused Shell of pipeline leaks that destroyed their farms in the Niger Delta area have won their 13 year battle in a Dutch court. Sky News reports that an appeal court in the Netherlands ruled against the oil giant. This means Shell would now be compensating the farmers for the leaks from a pipeline in the Niger Delta which covered an area equal to 60 football pitches.
