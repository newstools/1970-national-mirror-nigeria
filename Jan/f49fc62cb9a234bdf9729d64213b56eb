 Arsenal have confirmed the signing of Australian goalkeeper Mat Ryan on loan from Brighton for the remainder of the season. The 28-year-old Australian international had fallen out of favour at Brighton, losing his spot to Robert Sanchez after a 3-0 loss to Leicester in December. Arsenal were looking to sign an experienced stopper to provide competition for established No 1 Bernd Leno, with summer signing Runar Runarsson having failed to impress after Emiliano Martinez departs Emirate Stadium for Aston Villa. 💬 “All those mornings as a young kid in Australia, getting up to watch the Champions League games at four o’clock in the morning when I had school…” A wholesome first interview ❤️ 📺 Introducing… @MatyRyan — Arsenal (@Arsenal) January 22, 2021 Gunners made the announcement via the club website as the Technical director Edu said: “Mat is an experienced goalkeeper, a proven talent in the Premier League and has also played many internationals for Australia. Mat will further strengthen our squad with his experience and knowledge of playing at the highest level. “Following Matt Macey’s recent move to Hibernian, Mat will provide very good competition and positive support to all our goalkeepers and we are looking forward to him integrating quickly into the set-up here at Arsenal.” Post Views:
