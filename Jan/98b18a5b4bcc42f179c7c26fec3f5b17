 Sadiq Umar scored 30 minutes hat-trick as UD Almeria beat Ponferradina 3-1 to chase La Liga promotion. The 23-year-old former Olympic Eagles striker opened scoring tonight in the second minute before he doubled the tally on 21 minutes. However, Sadiq then completed his treble in the 29th minute with a cool finish inside the six-yard box as Almeria took a three-goal lead into the half-time break. Former AS Roma star had at least two more opportunities to increase the lead before he made way for Juan Villar in the 59th minute. Sadiq has now scored nine goals from 14 outings in the 2020-21 season as Almeria are third in the standings with 41 points, are three points behind table-topping Mallorca after 20 rounds. Four days later, they take on Kenneth Omeruoâ€™s Leganes in a league showdown billed for Estadio Municipal de Butarque.
