 Last year was an amazing experience as women from far and wide converged at The Fountain of Life Church, Ilupeju, Lagos to Take Over in their various spheres of influence. This year’s Discovery for Women Rally promises to be even more sensational as we reach further to have it all! Discovery for Women is a dynamic ministry dedicated to helping women to be the best God has ordained them to be. The ministry’s objective is to challenge, empower and motivate women to rise up and fulfill God’s divine purpose in their various roles as wives, mothers, and leaders.
