 With just one Premier League (PL) win – and no clean sheet – in nine matches (D2, L6) West Bromwich Albion remain mired in relegation trouble. Yet, although they’ve conceded a PL-high average of 2.26 goals per match this season, they’ve still scored between the 50th-60th minute in each of their last three competitive fixtures (W1, L2). There’s been action aplenty at The Hawthorns this term, as six (66.67%) out of West Brom’s nine home league games have produced over 2.5 goals, including each of the last four. They’ve conceded an average of 1.78 goals per fixture after the break as league hosts this season, although their only two PL clean sheets this term did come here. Manchester City are unbeaten in ten league games (W8, D2), and a win here would return them to the PL summit. Seven wins therein came ‘to nil’ and they’ve been outstanding early on, netting 20 (64.52%) out of 31 PL strikes this term before HT. Pertinently, City have scored an average of 1.83 first-half goals per fixture across the last 12 competitive H2Hs (W11, D1). Furthermore, only Tottenham Hotspur have a better first-half record on the road than the ‘Citizens’ this term (HT: W5, D1, L2) and they’ve scored eight (80%) of their ten goals on the road before the break. However, there is one cautionary note: although City have only failed to score in two (11.11%) league games this term, both were away from home. Odds A West Brom win has been priced at 16.40 odds with a Manchester City win coming with odds 1.17 odds and a draw attracting odds of 7.55. Betting Tip Manchester City are odds on favourites to win with odds of 1.17 and the bookies have it locked for a City win or a draw which attracts odds of 1.06.
