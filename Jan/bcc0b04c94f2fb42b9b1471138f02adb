 Rivers United will secure first position in the Nigeria Professional Football League table with a win over Adamawa United on Sunday afternoon. The Pride of Rivers are currently two points behind Nasarawa United, and will need all three points to overtake table toppers Nasarawa United. Technical adviser Stanley Eguma is likely to make changes to the side that lost to Kano Pillars 0-1on Wednesday. Adamawa United coach Justin Madugu may have been impressed by the performance of his players in their 1-2 lose to Enyimba on Matchday 6. That result has left the Yola based side at the bottom of the log with two points from six matches and without a win this season, but Madugu would be delighted with a point at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium.
