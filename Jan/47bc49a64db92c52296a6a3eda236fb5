 Super Eagles star Josh Maja has hailed Fulham’s 2-0 away win against Everton in the premier League as a great victory. The 22-year-old joined the Cottagers on loan for the rest of the season from Ligue 1 side Bordeaux. “A great day and great result! Not a bad full debut,” Maja told the club’s official website after the encounter. “It’s been a while since I started a game so I was happy to get that and I’m hoping to continue performances like this. “It is a weight off my shoulders. I felt coming in I would get opportunities and I was glad to take them.” Maja was selected to lead the attack by Fulham manager Scott Parker and support from midfield came from Ademola Lookman and Chelsea on loan star Ruben Loftus-Cheek. Following a goalless first half, Maja connected a well-timed cut-back from Ola Aina to put Fulham in front. He completed his brace in the 65th minute to finish the match 2-0. Fulham move to 18points but remain 18th on the log while Everton sit seventh on the premier league log with 37 points after 23 matches so far this season. Post Views:
