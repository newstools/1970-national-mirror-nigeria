 Former Super Eagles goalkeeper Dele Aiyenugba put up another splendid display on Sunday in the NPFL as he was solid in goal for Kwara United in their barren draw against MFM at the Agege Stadium. The veteran shot-stopper with his display at the Soccer Temple has now produced four clean sheets in four games with the Afonja Warriors. Impressive performance from Dele Aiyenugba in Lagos. Four clean sheets in four games.

Rivers United are back at the summit of the Nigeria Professional Football League table with their lone goal victory over Adamawa United at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt on Sunday. Fortune Omoniwari’s solitary goal in the 53rd minute proved adequate to give Rivers United maximum points in the matchday seven tie. Stanley Eguma’s men have so far amassed 15 points from the seven games they have played this season in the league. In Aba, Enyimba also recorded a 1-0 win over visiting Katsina United as Tosin Omoyele netted the decisive goal on the stroke of half-time. Excited to get my first goal for @EnyimbaFC and most importantly the maximum points.#WeAreTheElephant 🐘🐘🐘#TogetherForVictory pic.twitter.com/YKSiEHFCaS — Omoyele Tosin (@omoyele_tosin9) January 31, 2021 The Peoples’ Elephant have also garnered 15 points from the seven games played so far but they are behind Rivers United in second place due to their inferior goals difference. Elsewhere, Sunshine Stars put up an impressive performance as they beat Rangers 3-1 at the Akure Stadium on Sunday. Sadeeq Yusuf, Fuad Ekelojuoti and Chinedu Udechukwu got a goal each to ensure Gbenga Ogunbote had the last over his former employers. Godspower Aniefiok did pull one back for Rangers, nodding home substitute Dauda Madaki’s freekick a minute before the hour mark. It was however not enough to earn the Flying Antelopes a share of the spoils let alone the away win they had promised to fight for. Aniekan Ekpe bagged a brace as Dakkada returned to winning ways following a 2-0 win against Warri Wolves in Uyo. In Nnewi, FC IfeanyiUbah pip Wikki Tourists 1-0 courtesy of Ugochukwu Ifejiofor’s 17th-minute strike.
