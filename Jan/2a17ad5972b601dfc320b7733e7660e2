 Leicester City start this round of fixtures inside the Premier League’s (PL) top three having achieved eight wins from 12 PL rounds (L4), in what is their joint-highest number of victories at this stage of a top-flight campaign. Thanks to their win over Brighton last weekend, they’ve now scored four of their previous five home league goals in the first half, so a ninth PL victory could involve a lightning Leicester start. The ‘Foxes’ home league matches haven’t been short of entertainment either, with four of their six games producing over 2.5 goals. Brendan Rodgers’ side are always an attacking threat and boast the division’s joint-third best overall goals scored average (2.0), yet it’s worth noting that they have also allowed 4+ shots on target in five of their six PL home matches to date. After a slight wobble, Everton look to be getting back to their best after losing just one of their previous four PL matches (W2, D1, L1). However, Carlo Ancelotti’s side have conceded 2+ goals in 58.33% of their PL matches so far, yet their defence appears to be improving after each of their previous three PL fixtures witnessed the opposition score under 1.5 goals. The ‘Toffees’ have scored 75% of their PL away goals during the first half, and have subsequently trailed at HT in just one PL away fixture (HT: W2, D3, L1). They’ve also scored a first-half opener in their previous two visits to the King Power Stadium. Odds If you were to stake on a Leicester win, there would be odds of 2.05 and an Everton win gets 3.35 odds while a draw is priced at 3.85. Betting Tip A game involving two teams with potentially equal strength has all the trappings of ending in a stalemate but the bookies have given an Everton win or a draw and you can stake on Betpay with odds of 1.23 for that possibility. Prediction Leicester 2-2 Everton
