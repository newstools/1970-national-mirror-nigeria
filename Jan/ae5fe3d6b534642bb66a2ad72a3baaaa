 Kelechi Iheanacho’s brilliant goal during the 2-0 victory over Fulham has been hailed as a ‘dream goal’ by former Manchester United midfielder Owen Hargreaves. The Super Eagles forward was handed a starting role in the absence of injured topscorer Jamie Vardy and made himself proud when he ended his 15-game premier league goal drought at Craven Cottage. “What a ball from James Maddison, he puts it on a plate for Iheanacho,” Hargreaves told Premier League Production. “To be fair, Iheanacho adjusts absolutely brilliantly. This goal is a dream, Iheanacho with a lovely turn and then the rest of it is a dream.” Leicester moved into third spot on the Premier League table with 42 points from 22 games, behind leaders Manchester City and Manchester United.
