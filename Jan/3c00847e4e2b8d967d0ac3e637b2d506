AKA has finally broken his silence after his lovely fiancee, Nellie Tembe passed away. The renowned rapper broke his silence in a recent post he made on his verified social media handle on the popular social media platform, Instagram. He urged his fans and followers to continue to pray for his family and that of his late fiancee’s family adding that he will not be the one handling his social media for some time as he recovers from his loss. The post reads; “I have lost the love of my life….and every day feels like a mountain to climb. I miss Anele so much, and I’m heartbroken at the unfulfilled life we had planned together. The tragic loss of Anele has taken a great toll on me, emotionally and psychologically. Insinuations and innuendos made on my personhood have made it even more difficult to process and the strain our families have taken is unspeakable- which is why at this time I choose to retreat to honor my journey, praying those moments of stillness may bring me closer to some clarity.” I wish to convey my gratitude to all people who have supported me during this difficult time in my life, my mom Lynn and dad Tony, Bab’ Moses and Ndabezetha, my brother Steffan, my family (both Forbes and Tembe), my heartfelt gratitude to you all. To my business associates, political leaders, industry peers, and elders, friends and my neighbours, thank you for rallying around me. Last but not the least, to my incredibly loyal fans, the MEGACY, your collective love and support gas brought me much comfort. As we undergo this painful journey, I have entrusted my team to handle all of my affairs in the public domain, including all my social media platforms,. Please respect our privacy as we go through our grieving process, and please continue to keep our families in your prayers.”
