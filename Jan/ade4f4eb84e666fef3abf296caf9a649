 17 players begin Super Eagles players training in Austria ahead of Cameroon friendly clash on Friday at the Stadion Weiner Neustadt, Austria. Vice-captain of the team William Troost-Ekong and Leicester City midfielder Wilfred Ndidi lead Alex Iwobi, Kelechi Iheanacho, Shehu Abdullahi, Oghenekaro Etebo, Jamilu Collins and Peter Olayinka. Others are Valentine Ozornwafor, Anayo Iwuala, Samson Tijani, John Noble, Maduka Okoye, Francis Uzoho, while uncapped FC Lorient striker Terem Moffi and Portugal-based midfielder Abraham Marcus partake in the first training session. Their arrival is a massive boost for Super Eagles manager Gernot Rohr, who has been forced to deal with many withdrawals after Victor Osimhen, Semi Ajayi, Ola Aina, Simy Nwankwo and Tyronne Ebuehi and Kevin Akpoguma pulled out of the friendlies. Nigeria take on Cameroon in a doubleheader friendly encounter, with the first match taking place on Friday before the second game on Tuesday. Post Views:
