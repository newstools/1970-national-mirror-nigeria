 England and Manchester United legend Wayne Rooney has announced his retirement from football at the age of 35. Rooney is United’s all-time topscorer with 253 goals in 559 appearances in his 13 years spell at the club. However, Rooney’s retirement wasn’t down to injury or lack of ambition but because he accepted the new role as full-time manager of Championship side Derby County following the departure of Phillip Cocu in November. After breaking through at Everton, Rooney completed his transfer to Manchester United in August 2004, becoming the world’s most expensive teenager in the process. In the subsequent 13 years he spent in Manchester, he more than repaid that significant fee, scoring 253 goals in 559 games to overtake Sir Bobby Charlton at the summit of our all-time scoring charts.
