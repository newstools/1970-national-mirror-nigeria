 The abducted schoolgirls of the Government Secondary School in Jangebe, Zamfara State have regained their freedom. As we speak, they are in the palace of the Emir of Anka waiting for transportation to the state capital. This was revealed in a report made by the Sunday Punch and per the reports, negotiations with the bandits who kidnapped the schoolgirls had reached a very advanced stage. After they were kidnapped, the girls were believed to have been taken to a forest by the bandits who reportedly disguised themselves as security personnel. Per what we gathered, the girls were kept in the forest between Dangulbi and Sabon Birnin Banaga in the Maru Local Government Area of Zamfara State.
