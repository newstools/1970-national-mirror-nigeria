Beauty Youtuber, superinfluencer and lifestyle entrepreneur Jackie Aina launched a brand new vertical and itâ€™s all about self- care! Created to talk about her interests outside beauty, specifically lifestyle, self care and luxury, which dovetails perfectly with her lifestyle brand Forvr Mood. The tagline is so apt â€˜self care isnâ€™t selfish â€˜ and we canâ€™t wait to see what she does next! On the new page she shared: a little unboxing ðŸ¥° something a little different from me but thatâ€™s what Lavishly Jackie is, a lil something different! I canâ€™t wait to show you guys more of what I have planned for this page. and no itâ€™s not strictly just dedicated to luxury unboxings. stay tuned!!! The brand also has a Youtube page.
