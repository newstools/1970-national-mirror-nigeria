 The former African rugby playing duo of Kenyan-born Humphrey Kayange and Tendai Mtawarira, a Zimbabwean resident in South Africa, will this week inspire viewers with stories of their successful careers on the Globacom-sponsored Cable News Network (CNN) African Voices Changemakers programme. Before professionally venturing into rugby, thirty-nine-year-old Humphrey Kayange, obtained a degree in Organic Chemistry from Jomo Kenyatta University, Juja, Kenya.  He was part of the historic Kenyan squad that reached the semi-finals of the Rugby World Cup Sevens and was nominated for the International Rugby Board Sevens Player of The Year in 2009. For his exceptional talent in the 2008/2009 IRB world series, Kayange was awarded the Kenyan Presidential Order of Golden Warriors (OGW) alongside his brother who is equally an accomplished rugby player. He runs the Atlas Foundation which is a platform for mentoring and advocating for Kenyan athletes and young sports prospects in his country. His counterpart, thirty-five-year-old Tendai Mtawarira nicknamed ‘The Beast’, opted to play his national career for South Africa in 2008. He was caped for 117 times throughout his illustrious career for the country, making him the most capped player in South African history and the third most-capped Springbok of all time. The highlight of his career was winning the 2019 Rugby World Cup winner. Upon retirement in 2020, Mtawarira established The Beast Foundation, through which he builds a community of enthusiastic young people who aspire to find their feet in sports and education. The African rugby stars will share their stories to stardom in the new edition of the programme which comes on up on CNN (DSTV Channel 401) on Saturday at 9.30 a.m. Repeats of the program will be beamed on Sunday at 7.30 a.m., 12.30 p.m., 7.30 p.m., 11.30 p.m. and on Monday at 5.30 a.m.
