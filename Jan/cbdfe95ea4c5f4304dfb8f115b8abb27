 COVID-19: Banky W Faults Government Decision To Continue NIN Registration Nigerian entertainer and politician Banky W, says the Federal Government’s decision to go ahead with the National Identification Number (NIN) registration is unnecessary. This comes after the federal government moved the deadline for the NIN registration till February 9, 2021. The singer took to his twitter account to lash at the Government’s poor management of the situation. According to him, the registration is unnecessary during a second wave of the pandemic. Calling it madness, he tweeted: “This is completely responsible of us as a country, to insist on this mad scramble for NIN numbers in the middle of Covid’s 2nd wave. People are dying. We should be smarter/wiser/better than this for goodness sake.” See his post below: Can we take more pictures & videos of NIN enrollment centers and post them to @NCDCgov @NigeriaGov @NGRPresident. How they can tell us to do social distancing on one hand and then use this NIN madness to expose all of us to covid? We must embarrass them into doing the right thing pic.twitter.com/eRFJsYJo8h — Banky Wellington (@BankyW) January 22, 2021 @NCDCgov @NigeriaGov @NGRPresident This is completely responsible of us as a country, to insist on this mad scramble for NIN numbers in the middle of Covid's 2nd wave.
