Nigerian songstress Tiwa Savage has recounted how she wanted to bleach her skin when she was 14 years. In an interview with Allure Magazine, Tiwatope Savage simply known as Tiwa opened up on the difficulties and struggles she went through accepting who she is. She disclosed how it was difficult to blend among her white friends growing up as a child. She stated that she mixed creams with lemon in the quest to bleach her skin but her mother found out and was disappointed. “I actually did try to bleach my skin when I was about, I think 14 or 15 years. Even now I have patches on my back. My mom was cleaning my room and saw the cream that I used to mix with lemons. She wasn’t angry. it was more her disappointment. So I stopped but I was always insecure about being dark” she told Allure magazine. Tiwa Savage made this revelation when she was featured on the cover of this month’s issue of the magazine. “I have a platform and I’m digging more into my responsibility for younger people,” she says. . When I started my career I wasn’t embracing who I was fully yet because I was just trying to crack into the market,” she says. “My first two singles were very American and it wasn’t very African. But then, as time went on, I just started seeing how powerful my platform was and how mothers would say, ‘My little girl really looks up to you.’ “And I feel like there’s so much pressure now and it’s going to get even worse with social media and there needs to be a balance. There need to be some people that are not too perfect. I know we want to look good. I don’t want to be out there looking jacked up, but I also want to look relatable.” she revealed.
