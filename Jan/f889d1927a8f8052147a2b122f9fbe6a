 Alexandre Lacazette netted twice as Arsenal convincingly beat Semi Ajayi’s West Brom 4-0 in the Premier League encounter at The Hawthorns. Defender Kieran Tierney’s excellent solo run and curling finish put the Gunners in front in the first half, before the impressive Bukayo Saka rounded off a stunning passing move to make it 2-0. Lacazette added the third and fourth goals after the break – smashing in a rebound from Emile Smith Rowe’s shot before he was set up by Tierney. Three straight wins and back-to-back clean sheets for Mikel Arteta’s resurgent Gunners as the North London outfit move up to 11th place and six points adrift of the top four. West Brom, playing their fourth match under new manager Sam Allardyce, remain second from bottom and six points from safety.
