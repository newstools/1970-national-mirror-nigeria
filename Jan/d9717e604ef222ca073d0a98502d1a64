 Aisha Buhari First Lady, Aisha Buhari, broke her long silence as she sent a goodwill message to Nigerian women on International Women’s Day. Outspoken Mrs Buhari had gone off the radar around September 2020 shortly after the wedding of her daughter, Hanan. An online newspaper, SaharaReporters, had reported that she relocated to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, citing security issues. But shortly after, one of her aides, Kabiru Dodo, said Mrs Buhari was on a foreign medical trip. No word was heard from her even when she turned 50 years old on February 18. But on Monday, she posted a goodwill message on her Twitter handle, @Aishambuhari. The message which she signed personally was titled “Message of the First Lady, Federal Republic of Nigeria, Dr Aisha Muhammadu Buhari, on the occasion of the International Women’s Day 2021.” The President’s wife lamented the continued abduction of women and girls in Nigeria by bandits and terrorists. She called on all stakeholders to continue to exert their different levels of influence and bring the abductions to an end. The message read, “Today marks the 2021 edition of International Women’s Day. The day offers yet another opportunity for humanity to review and reflect progress made on issues of women and girls.
