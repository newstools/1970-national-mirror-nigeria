 The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has warned on planned attacks on all airports across the country. This was made known by the Deputy General Manager, Administration and Logistics of FAAN, S. M. Mamman. According to the report by the Cable, Mr, Mamman wrote to the heads of security, and in his statement, he listed the airports in Kaduna, Maiduguri, Sokoto, Kano, Abuja, and Lagos as the targets. The statement partly reads; “I am directed to convey an alert from the Ministry of Aviation regarding security threats by criminal elements against Airports in Nigeria and to request for the immediate enumeration of necessary countermeasures for the protection of Airports/Facilities under your purview.” Weeks ago, some unknown gunmen reportedly kidnapped nine people from the Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) quarters in Kaduna. The people abducted included a family of six and a housewife with her two children. This was confirmed by an Engineer in the Airport. Speaking with The Nation, he said; “Initially, when I started hearing gunshots, I was not even bothered, because I thought whoever came here to rob or do anything has made a mistake of his life because we have a military barrack at the airport. But, I later became restless when after like 30 minutes, bullets were still raining. Along the line, the soldiers came in and engaged the bandits in a serious gun battle, but the soldiers could only prevent them from picking more people because the bandits came with two RPGs alongside their many AK47 rifles. The attack lasted for hours as the military personnel tried fiercely to resists the attack but the bandits had their way. They went away with nine people, including six people from a single-family. The bandits escaped with all the nine victims by putting them on their motorcycles. We are now left with tension and fear. The whole place is litter with bullet cells and holes on the wall.”
