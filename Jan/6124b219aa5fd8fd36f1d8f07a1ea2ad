 In its bid to halt the flagrant abuse of traffic laws by commercial motorcyclists, Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) on Tuesday, impounded 81 motorcycles for plying restricted routes in the state. The motorcycles were impounded at Jakande Estate and Isolo for plying restricted routes and endangering the lives of other road users. The Chairman, Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Unit, CSP Shola Jejeloye, who led the operation stated that the seizure was in line with enforcement of the Lagos State Traffic Law and to halt the flagrant abuse of traffic laws by the motorcyclists. He noted that government is concerned about the recklessness of motorcyclists on restricted routes, and it, therefore, becomes necessary to help the motorcyclists by saving their lives and that of other road users. He pointed out that the government would not fold its arms and allow motorcyclists to create chaos for other road users on prohibited routes. He added that it has become crucial for the government to prevent an increase in the trend of crime perpetrated by motorcyclists in the metropolis, particularly in prohibited routes. Jejeloye restated the agencyâ€™s commitment to continue the clampdown on recalcitrant motorcyclists plying restricted routes, adding that the move would help safeguard the security of lives and property. The Chairman called for the co-operation of Lagosians by desisting from boarding motorcycles in prohibited areas, emphasizing that the state Traffic Law is in the larger interest of the society.
