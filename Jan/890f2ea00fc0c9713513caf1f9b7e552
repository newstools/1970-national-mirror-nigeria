 Liverpool coach Jurgen Klopp to battle Manchester United for new African hotshot Kamaldeen Sulemana, according to FC Nordsjælland manager Flemming Pedersen. The 19-year-old Ghanian winger has been in fine form this season after netting 10 goals while providing seven assists for the Danish club and has quickly attracted the attention of some of Europe’s biggest clubs with Ajax technical director, Marc Overmaars believed to have made a £12million offer but it was rejected in Janaury transfer window. However, according to Daily Mail via TV3 Sport reports Liverpool coach Klopp is eager to bring Kamaldeen to Anfield this summer but the dethroned Premier League Champions will have to battle rival with Manchester United for the signature for Ghanian rising star. And Nordsjælland manager Flemming Pedersen has confirmed that two top Premier League join Ajax in the race for Sulemana. “That’s a really good question. Ajax is perhaps the safe choice where he will definitely get plenty of playing time,” he told TV3 Sport when asked where Sulemana is most likely to end up next. “[Manchester] United, Liverpool, and others are in the race. Well, I also know Kamal so well that when he is pressured, he automatically takes the next step as well. And with the personality and mentality he has, there I will never ever say it will be too big a leap, for he is extraordinary,” he added. When asked if he expects the teenager to leave this summer he responded, “You could well assume that.” “I cannot stand here to say that I expect him to be here next season because there is so much talk about him. ‘That’s completely understandable, and I myself helped hype him last spring when he made his debut. But we have to see what happens.” Despite only making his professional debut last year, Sulemana has already won two caps for Ghana at the full international level. Post Views:
