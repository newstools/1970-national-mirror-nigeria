 Steven Gerrard has hailed the performance of Rangers in their hard fought 1-0 win over Hibernian in a Scottish Premiership match. The match which featured Super Eagles duo, Leon Balogun and Joe Aribo saw both Nigerians on show for 90 minutes at the Ibrox Stadium but it was Ianis Hagi that made the difference for the title chasing Gers. Gerrard said: “Hibs did extremely well to stay in the game. Jack (Ross) sets them up extremely well and they always carry a threat because they’ve got good players. “But I’ve got even more praise for my team for getting over the line and winning it because we knew it was going to be a tough challenge. We’ve stood up to that and managed it extremely well. “If you don’t get that second goal you’re going to get a few nervy moments towards the end – but it’s a big win, clean sheet and 12 on the spin now, so I’m really happy. “Resilience and character are a must. If we want to go the distance it’s not always going to be easy. You know you’re going to have to rely on your big players to stand up and be counted and I thought we did.” Rangers are on top of the table with 56 points, 16 more than second placed Celtic – although they have played three games more this season.
