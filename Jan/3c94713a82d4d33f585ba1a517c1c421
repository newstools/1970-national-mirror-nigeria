 Enyimba have confirmed their place in the CAF Confederation Cup Group Stage after they overcame their fierce local rivals Rivers United 5-4 via penalties on Sunday. The People’s Elephant won the first leg 1-0 last week in Aba and Rivers United through Fortune Omoniwari cancelled the deficit in Sunday’s reverse leg at the Adokiye Amaesimaka Stadium just before the end of the first. Both teams tried hard for headway in the second half but there was nothing to separate both sides after 90 minutes The game proceeded into penalty kicks and it was Enyimba who prevailed 5-4. Enyimba will on Monday know who their group foes will be as the draw for the second-tier club competition will be conducted in Cairo. Since its inception, no Nigerian team has ever won the CAF Confederation Cup but Enyimba will be looking to rewrite the history books this term. For Rivers United, they would be disappointed they failed in their bid on the continent despite the promise they have shown that they are indeed ready to rub shoulders with the continent’s best teams.
