 The Ekiti government, on Monday, says it has approved the disbursement of N60 million loan to the state Teaching Service Commission (TESCOM) staff members as a housing loan for the last quarter of 2020. A statement issued by Chairman of the commission, Mr Babatunde Abegunde, in Ado-Ekiti, said that the amount was approved for disbursement to 220 beneficiaries, comprising both teaching and non-teaching staffers. Abegunde did not, however, state how much would go to each of the workers. He expressed appreciation to Gov. Kayode Fayemi for the gesture, saying that it would further boost the morale of the workers. The chairman said that the continued release of funds for the housing and vehicle loan schemes since the inception of the present administration had been a source of encouragement and motivation to teachers and other staffers, as it had enabled them build houses and purchase their own vehicles with ease. “Cumulatively, an amount of N340,754,231.74 had been released from October 2018 when this administration came on board till date, with a total of 2,459 staffers as beneficiaries so far”, he said. According to him, this is a demonstration of the governor’s commitment to the welfare of workers, describing him as “a teacher-friendly and caring leader”. The TESCOM boss particularly commended Fayemi for his commitment to staff welfare, in spite of the economic challenges, occasioned by the COVID-19 pandemic. Abegunde, who stated that the loans would be revolving, appealed to those yet to benefit to exercise patience, assuring that it would soon reach their turn. He enjoined the beneficiaries and others to reciprocate the present administration’s gestures by being more dedicated, loyal, and committed to their duties. NAN Vanguard News Nigeria
