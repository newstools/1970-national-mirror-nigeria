 Nigerian billionaire businessman, politician and philanthropist, Ned Nwoko has stated that polygamous marriages help the society and made northern side part of Nigeria the majority in the country. Speaking to BBC Igbo, Ned Nwoko said the average northerner is married to two wives and this phenomenon has prevented women from engaging in prostitution. Ned who is married to six wives including Nollywood actress, Regina Daniels and a Moroccan, Laila Charani noted that Christianity does not allow polygamy. In his words; “The average Northerner marrying two, three, four women, they are helping the society because it is the economic downturn that has affected so many women who you see doing prostitution and all that. But the fallacy of it all is that Christianity does not allow that in the South and yet, the average Southern man has 10 girlfriends.” “I love my culture as I know it, not as they are trying to dilute it. Igbo culture is wonderful and should be promoted the way it has always been. But even looking at that, look at your population in Nigeria and what I will call the economy of marriage, as an Igbo man with one wife, four children, a Northerner has four wives with five children each, in the next 10 years, 20 years, imagine the population of the Northerners.”
