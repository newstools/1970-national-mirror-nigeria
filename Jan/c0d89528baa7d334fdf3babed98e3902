 Super Eagles star, Victor Osimhen has been rated the fourth most valuable African player. The Napoli player is in good company with Liverpool duo, Mohamed Salah, Sadio Mane and new Inter Milan signing Achraf Hakimi. The CIES Football Observatory released its bi-annual list of the top five league players with the biggest transfer values and according to its report, the Nigerian is valued at 62.2 million euros. Interestingly, Osimhen joined Napoli for 81.3 million euros from Ligue 1 side, Lille but has failed to light up the league so far due to injuries, suspensions and currently Coronavirus. According to the CIES Football Observatory, the Super Eagles forward has played competitive football since he injured his shoulders on international duties with Nigeria. Osimhen was allowed to visit Nigeria during the winter break but he attended a surprise birthday party for him in Lagos and on his return to Naples he tested positive to Coronavirus which left the club angry. The CIES Football Observatory considers a player’s age, performance, and length of contract, club success and wealth before releasing their list. Africa’s most valuable talent is Mohamed Salah with a transfer value of 134.0 million euros followed by his Liverpool teammate, Saido Mane, who is valued at 123.8 million euros. Inter Milan defender, Hakimi, sits third with a value of 113.7 million euros. Post Views:
