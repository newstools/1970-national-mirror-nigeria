 Heartland FC suffered their second consecutive defeat in the new Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season on Sunday as they were pipped 2-1 by visiting Nasarawa United at the Dan Anyiam Stadium, Owerri. The Naze Millionaires who lost 3-2 in their season-opener to Katsina United last weekend were widely tipped to get their first win of the new campaign against Nasarawa United but that was not the case. A goal in each half from Chinedu Ohanachom and Adamu Hassan was adequate to give the Solid Miners a crucial away win and take them to the summit of the NPFL log. This is the third away win in the NPFL 2020/21 season following similar feats by Kwara United and Rivers United. In Uyo, Dakkada FC came from a goal down before emerging victorious against Jigawa Golden Stars. There were slim 1-0 wins for Rangers, Sunshine Stars, Lobi Stars, Warri Wolves over Akwa United, FC Ifeanyi Ubah, MFM FC, and Adamawa United respectively.
