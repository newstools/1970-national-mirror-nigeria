 Former Super Eagles captain John Obi Mikel was in action for 90 minutes as Stoke City suffered a heavy 4-0 loss to Leicester City in their FA Cup third-round tie at bet365 Stadium. Leicester advanced to the fourth round in a comfortable fashion as the Premier League high-fliers beat the Potters emphatically. James Justin put the Foxes in front with a fine strike in the 34th minute, shortly after Sam Vokes had missed a good chance to give the Championship hosts the lead. Marc Albrighton doubled the advantage with a 59th-minute finish, Ayoze Perez made it 3-0 with 11 minutes of normal time to go, and Harvey Barnes added a fourth two minutes later. The Super Eagles duo of Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho featured for Leicester City in the big win. Post Views:
