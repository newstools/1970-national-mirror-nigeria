 Super Eagles forward Victor Osimhen has been fined two weeks wages by Serie A side Napoli, according to reports. The former Golden Eaglets star who just turned 22, was allowed to travel to Nigeria for Christmas break and he tested positive upon his return to Naples – that angered the Italian club and manager Gennaro Gattuso as the striker breached Covid-19 regulations. Napoli shared a statement on their official twitter handle on New Year’s Day, it read: ‘The club can confirm that Victor Osimhen has tested positive for COVID-19 following his return to Italy. Osimhen is currently asymptomatic and has not come into contact with the rest of the squad.’ In a video published on social media by DJ Michael Golden, Osimhen was seen dancing and spraying money like a Nigerian politician during his birthday party on December 29 in the midst of people without face masks. There was also no social distance observed in the video shared. Osimhen has not played competitive football since he injured his shoulder while representing Nigeria in November against Sierre Leone and has also missed seven Serie A games and four Europa League matches for Napoli. The Nigerian was scheduled to return against Cagliari on January 3 after the winter break, having trained in Belgium without pain and looked ready ahead of his return to action. But he will now miss a further two weeks in isolation. Osimhen’s last game for Napoli before the shoulder injury was on November 8 against Bologna and he netted the winner during a 1-0 victory at the Renato Dall’Ara.
