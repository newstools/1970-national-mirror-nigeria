 Union Berlin forward Taiwo Awoniyi has hailed teammate and forgotten Super Eagles star Anthony Ujah for helping him settle at the club. The Liverpool star who is currently on loan with Urs Fischer’s side, has scored five goals this season with three of the strikes coming in his last three matches. “I’ll give kudos to my Nigerian big brother, Anthony Ujah, because he helped me a lot in getting into the team, he told me stuff [about] what the coach expected and everything. I think those are part of the things that helped me to get going in the team,” he said. Union sporting director Oliver Ruhnert believed that the Nigeria U23 international would flourish in the German capital and he is now repaying that confidence. “With his physical robustness, his team spirit and work around the box, he should make our attacking game more flexible and further stimulate the attack,” Ruhnert said when Awoniyi arrived at Union in mid-September.
