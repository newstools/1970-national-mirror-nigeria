 Boss Mustapha The Presidential Task Force (PTF) on COVID-19 has revealed that a total number of 129 million doses of vaccine will be received by Nigeria. This was made known by the Chairman of the PTF and Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF), Mr Boss Mustapha. In his submission, he said that the vaccines are coming from COVID-19 Vaccines Global Assess Facility (COVAX) and the African Vaccine Acquisition Task Team (AVATT). He added that the first batch, which is four million doses, will arrive on Tuesday, March 2 stating that the vaccine allocation being expected is at no financial cost to Nigeria. He said; “Well, I can assure you that the vaccines are coming, and they are coming very quickly, barring any change in the delivery plan that has been released to us by UNICEF, like I said, barring any change, because the logistical arrangements and other things are in the hands of the UNICEF, we believe that the vaccines should depart India tonight, March 1, and arrive Abuja tomorrow morning. So we are making preparation for that.” SGF, Boss Mustapha, confirming the arrival of the Covid-19 Vaccine on 2nd March 2021 and elaborating on plans by the Federal Government for the vaccination campaign, Other issues surrounding vaccine storage and logistics @BossMustaphaSGF @DigiCommsNG @NCDCgov @NphcdaNG @MBuhari pic.twitter.com/6jRL0HpGA9 — TVC News (@tvcnewsng) February 28, 2021
