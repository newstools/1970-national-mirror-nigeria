As former President Donald Trump passed the torch to President Joe Biden during the official inauguration on Wednesday morning, many tweeted, took screen grabs and memes to describe their reactions to it all. Everyone from the comfort of their homes saw President Joe Biden recite the 35-word oath of office swearing to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution” in a ceremony administered by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., as First Lady Jill Biden held the Bible. From Michelle Obama‘s stunning look to Lady Gaga‘s powerful rendition of the American anthem and Kamala Harris‘ new beginning, here are some of the reactions from today’s one-of-a-kind inauguration: See Inauguration.. No asoebi, No too much serenre.. Here, Budget for Apc Asoebi wrapper, shirts, caps, rice, matches, tin tomatoes and brooms is the 6 months budget of one state.. These guys are just wasting our resources 😭 — The Hair Plug (@Msmenalicious) January 20, 2021 See as inauguration dey organized and quiet.

(@Oli_Ekun) January 20, 2021 As Trump is leaving the white house, Kamala Harris will be sworn in as the first female Vice President of the United States.
