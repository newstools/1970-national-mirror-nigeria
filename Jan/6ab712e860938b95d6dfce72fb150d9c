 Tiger Woods has shared a photo of himself on crutches and with a small cast covering his right foot and ankle on a golf course. The photo, which Woods posted on Instagram on Friday afternoon, is the first of Woods since he was involved in a serious one-vehicle crash on Feb. 23 in Southern California. The 15-time major champion underwent surgery on open fractures to his lower right leg and further injuries to his foot and ankle following the crash.
