Fulham manager Scott Parker told the club’s official website that former Sunderland striker only arrived at the club on Tuesday and must work up to match fitness. “Josh is not here at the moment, he comes in today, he’s not played over the last three or four games so we need to see physically where he is,” “Ability-wise Josh was here as a young boy, he’s played in English football so I don’t see that as an issue. Probably more just where he is physically and we’ll judge that. “Physically where he is, is something we’ll have to work out. I brought Josh to the football club because he’s someone who I see with big potential, someone I see we can develop. “When you look at the transfer work we’ve done this season in Antonee Robinson, Tosin, Harrison Reed, Ademola Lookman, even Ruben Loftus-Cheek.
