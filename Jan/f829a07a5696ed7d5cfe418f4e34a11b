 Obiageli Ezekwesili, former minister of education, has officially petitioned the inspector-general of police, Usman Baba to investigate and prosecute Japheth Omojuwa, a social media influencer, for identity fraud. Ezekwesili had dissociated herself from Alpha Reach, a company owned by Omojuwa, after Omojuwa accused her of giving her full consent as she made her a director in the company. According to Ezekwesili, the matter should be looked into for justice to prevail. The statement read: “Japheth Omojuwa never sought for her consent and /or participation in incorporating any company whatsoever and for any purpose whatsoever,” “The said Japheth Omojuwa neither sought for nor obtained requisite incorporation documents and information the CAC would require in processing the registration i.e the particulars of directors, share numbers, signature of directors, means of identification of directors and address etc. “Our client reiterates for emphasis that she never filled or signed the statutory consent of first directors of Alpha Reach Company Limited in 2012 and or at anytime whatsoever. “The foregoing infractions amount to forgery, fraudulent misrepresentation, and egregious breach of extant provisions of the Penal Code Law, the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, 2015 and the Companies and Allied Matters Act, deserving of investigation and prosecution.” “Whilst pledging our cooperation towards the just resolution of the instant matter, our faith in the capacity of the Nigeria Police force under your stellar leadership to cause an immediate, diligent and thorough investigation into this crime, aimed at getting to the root of this case and bringing the suspect to justice is resolute and unshaken.”
