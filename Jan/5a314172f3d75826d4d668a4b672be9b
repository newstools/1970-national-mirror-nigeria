 The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) has opened investigations into Gimba Yau Kumo, a son-in-law of President Muhammadu Buhari, for an alleged $65 million fraud. Kumo is reported to have perpetrated the crime with accomplices, Tarry Rufus and another Bola Oguns whose whereabouts are currently unknown. Kumo walked down the aisle with his sweetheart Fatima, one of the president’s daughters in 2016 Gimba Yau Kumo, a native of Gombe State is a graduate of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and he served as Managing Director of the Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria, under ex-President Goodluck Jonathan. It could be recalled that barely a week after Kumo’s marriage to President Buhari’s daughter, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) went after him over a three billion naira fraud he allegedly committed as Managing Director of Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria. In a statement on Thursday, Azuka Ogugua, spokesperson of the anti-graft commission, asked anyone who had information on the whereabouts of the trio to report to the ICPC headquarters or the nearest police station. “The persons whose pictures appear above, Mr. Tarry Rufus, Mr. Gimba Yau Kumo and Mr. Bola Ogunsola, are hereby declared WANTED by the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) in connection with issues bordering on misappropriation of National Housing Funds and diversion of the sum of Sixty Five Million dollars ($65,000,000),” the ICPC said. “Anyone who has useful information on their whereabouts should report to ICPC Headquarters Abuja, any of the ICPC State Offices or the nearest police station.”
