 The Joint Admission and Matriculations Board (JAMB) has hinted at the possibility of the postponement of the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), which is slated to hold between June 5 and June 19, 2021. This follows the difficulty experienced by some candidates when trying to register for the examinations and the likely extension of the registration. This disclosure was made by the Registrar of JAMB, Professor Is’aq Oloyede, at a zoom meeting titled, ‘Briefing session for the committees on 2021 UTME’, with stakeholders. Oloyede, who said that the board will decide if there is a need to extend the registration period and change the date of the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, however, stated that the Mock examination would still go ahead on May 20 as stipulated earlier.
