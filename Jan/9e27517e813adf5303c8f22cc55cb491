 Nigerian striker Olarenwaju Kayode was the hero for Sivasspor on Thursday as he scored a very late goal that ensured the passage of his team into the Round of 16 phase of the Turkish Cup. Sivasspor had to dig very deep before they could get the 1-0 win over Giresunspor and it was Kayode that popped up with the winning goal in stoppage time. With Thursday’s goal which is his 5th of the season, the Super Eagles striker has now scored in every competition he has played in for Sivasspor.
