 Henry Onyekuru marked his return to Turkey in spectacular fashion as he scored a brace against Gaziantep FK during a Super Lig match on Friday evening. The former Everton player who helped the club win the 2018-19 Turkish Super Lig title was assigned the number 7 jersey on his return to the club for a third loan spell. Onyekuru was introduced just before the restart of the second half and he wasted no time in reminding the fans of his super football skills with a good after five minutes. The Nigerian did not stop there as he doubled the lead for the away side to make it 2-0 before the home side scored late on to end the match 2-1. The other Nigerian on show was Oghenekaro Etebo, he played the final 15 minutes of the encounter after coming off the bench. Post Views:
