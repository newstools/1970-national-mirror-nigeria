 Femi Falana Human rights lawyer, Mr. Femi Falana (SAN), has said Sunday Igboho, had no right to issue a vacation notice to Fulani herders in the Ibarapa Local Government Area of Oyo State. Igboho, who is the Akoni Oodua of Yoruba land, had asked herdsmen accused of perpetrating crimes ranging from kidnappings, killings, rape to invasion of farmlands with their cattle to leave within seven days. At the expiration of the ultimatum last week, he and his followers had stormed the Fulani settlement in Igangan to eject Seriki Fulani, Salihu Abdukadir, and the herders. But Falana advised the affected herders to seek redress in court, saying, “Anybody who is affected by such illegal quit notices would have to go to court to stop whoever is issuing the notices. That is the law but don’t let us resort to violence; it is unnecessary.” The senior advocate, who spoke on a BBC programme on Wednesday, argued that some of the evicted herders had lived in Ibarapaland for many years and have the constitutional rights to do so. Falana said, “With profound respect under our laws, even a squatter cannot be ejected and that is why on a daily basis, tenants are given quit notices by landlords or owners of properties.
