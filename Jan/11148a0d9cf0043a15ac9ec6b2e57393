 Rev. fr. Mbaka Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka has revealed that the Adoration Ministry Enugu Nigeria (AMEN) would be shut down for the time being. In a statement released, Mbaka said there will be no activity held at the Ministry located at Umuchigbo in Enugu East during this time as it would be closed for a month. This follows the order of the Bishop of Enugu Diocese, Most Rev Calistus Onaga who demanded the closure of the ministry and the start of a 30-day retreat. This notice made available on Tuesday May 11 to members of the ministry was to direct them to observe this one-month private prayer retreat. It read; “Our Spiritual Director, Rev Fr Ejike Mbaka wishes to inform his beloved adorers that he has embarked on a private prayer retreat that will end on 10th June 2021. Consequently, no ministry activities shall be held in the ministry ground pending his return. “He directs that members of the ministry are to observe this period of his retreat as they used to do during the usual January breaks of the ministry, by praying at their homes, being charitable and fasting according to their ability. Adoration! Holy spirit is our power.” Meanwhile, Father Ejike Mbaka, spiritual director of Adoration Ministries Enugu Nigeria (AMEN), had apologized to the Catholic church for his shortcomings. Mbaka asked the bishop of the diocese, Callistus Onaga, to forgive him and his followers for their words and actions which have harmed the church’s reputation, while delivering his sermon on Sunday in a video obtained by SaharaReporters. He also warned his supporters not to resort to violence after several of them broke into the diocesan cathedral on Wednesday when his whereabouts remained unclear for many hours.
