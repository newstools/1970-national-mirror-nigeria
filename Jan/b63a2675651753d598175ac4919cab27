 U.S President Elect Joe Biden The United States Congress has affirmed President-elect Joe Biden’s Electoral College victory over President Donald Trump. The counting of Vermont’s three electoral votes put Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris over the 270-threshold needed to win the presidency. “The announcement of the state of the vote by the President of the Senate shall be deemed a sufficient declaration of the persons elected President and Vice President of the United States, each for the term beginning on the 20th day of January 2021 and shall be entered together with the list of the votes on the journals of the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Pence said following the count of all the Electoral College votes. The certification comes after Pro-Trump rioters invaded the US Capitol on Wednesday. Lawmakers in the Senate and House of Representatives successfully beat back Republican efforts to deny Biden the electoral votes from swing states Arizona and Pennsylvania. The joint session of Congress, which is normally a ceremonial step, was halted for several hours when rioters breached the Capitol. Proceedings resumed at about 8 p.m. ET with Vice President Mike Pence, bringing the Senate session back into order.
