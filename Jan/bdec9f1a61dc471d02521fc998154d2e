 Kenneth Omeruo is delighted after scoring the winner in Leganes 2-1 win over Umar Sadiq’s Almeria in the Spanish Segunda Division encounter at Estadio Butarque on Wednesday night. The 27-year-old Nigeria international makes his 14 league appearances of the season but former Olympic Eagles star put Almeria ahead eight minutes of action in Madrid to notch his 12 goals of the campaign. However, Borja Baston drew level minutes after the restart for Leganes before Omeruo made the difference in time added on to make it 2-1. Super Eagles defender took to his Instagram handle to celebrate the victory over his fellow countryman Sadiq’s Almeria as the push to return to La Liga next term. Leganes thus remain in fourth place on 46 points, while Almeria have 49 points and are third. Mallorca lead the championship with 51 points. Post Views:
