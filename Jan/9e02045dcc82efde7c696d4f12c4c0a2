 Yemi Alade Talks Nigerian Economy And Recording New Album In Amsterdam Nigerian Afro-Pop singer and entertainer, Yemi Alade, in an exclusive chat with OSG talks about the Nigerian economy and recording an album in Amsterdam. Speaking on how she has been handling the current economic situation and devaluation of the Naira, Yemi says she has been taking things “one day at a time.” “Some people who have dollars will be happy but the truth of the matter is that as long as you are in Nigeria, whether you have dollars to whatever currency, it’s like robbing Peter to pay Paul. If one suffers you suffer as well because you are still Nigerian you know? So, it is not a happy place to be,” she continued.  Yemi Alade Album Cover “Empress” “At the end of the day, you find out that investments you made in Naira are basically devaluing because of that and you also find that the little things you need to live and go buy from the market. At the end of the day, it is not a win win for everybody,” she further reinstated. Chatting excitedly about recording her album “Empress” in Amsterdam, the pop star had this to say: “Empress is a special album not just because it was released in 2020 but because we on our team decided that we were going to record this album outside the country. So myself and two Nigerian producers, Vtek and Egarboy travelled all the way to Amsterdam and we recorded the entire album. 80% of the album was recorded there.” Watch the full interview below:
