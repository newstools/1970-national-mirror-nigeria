Popular Nollywood actress, Toyin Abraham has reacted to Ruggedman’s recent tweet questioning actresses who make more money than their male colleagues in Nollywood. My male actors in nollywood whats going on? Its just the females that are buying cars and building houses left and right. I wanted to come into nollywood but at this rate, I am not coming again ? — RUGGEDMAN (@RuggedyBaba) February 5, 2021 Abraham took to her Instagram page on Monday, February 8, 2021, with an explanation as to the huge financial gap between actors and actresses in the industry. According to her, “It is important that I put this out there that many women make money and make good money legitimately. I know actresses who charge 2 million, 3 million and 5 million in this Nollywood. I get paid in millions of naira for gigs. I know a lot of men in Nollywood who are doing extra ordinarily well and paid in millions. The fact that most of these men choose not to make noise on social media do not in any way mean that they are second class citizens in this industry. “We need to stop attributing every woman’s success to her sexual prowess with men, women deserve the success they have as much as men without attributing it to their sexuality. Nollywood women like Bimbo Ademoye, Nancy Isime, Kehinde Bankole, Inidima Okojie , Sharon Ooja, Bisola Aiyeola, are getting paid in millions”.
