 Chelsea is preparing to offload five players to fund a move for inter Milan star Romelu Lukaku, according to a report. Inter Milan is open to a deal that would see the striker leave the San Siro stadium at the end of the season following a stellar performance for the Nerazzuri. Lukaku was a former Chelsea player but he endured a difficult time at the club before he secured a move to Everton and later Manchester United before joining Inter Milan.  Lukaku, 28, endured an unsuccessful spell at Chelsea earlier in his career. In 15 appearances he failed to score and was sold to Everton. Lukaku was one of the main players in Antonio Conte’s team during the last season, where he scored 30 goals as Inter Milan put an end to the nine years dominance of Juventus in Serie A. The Belgian attacker moved to Inter Milan from Manchester United and his last season show in Serie A attracted the Blues who are enduring difficulty in putting the ball at the back of the net – and will hope to recoup the funds through player sales. The future of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Callum Hudson-Odoi, Ross Barkley, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Tammy Abraham are in line. Abraham has scored 30 goals across the last two seasons and might feel aggrieved, Hudson-Odoi is still young and boasts a lot of untapped potentials. The other three of Kepa, Barkley and Loftus-Cheek, however, are on borrowed time and have no future at Chelsea. Post Views:
