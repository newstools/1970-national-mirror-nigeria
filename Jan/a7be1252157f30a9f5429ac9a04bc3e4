 Super Eagles striker Kelechi Iheanacho is delighted after scoring in the Leicester City 2-1 comeback win over Brighton in the Premier League encounter at Amex Stadium. The 24-year-old Nigeria international who had rescued a point for the Foxes in another away tie at Turf Moor against Burnley got the equaliser for Leicester City against Brighton before Daniel Amartey grabbed the winner for the Foxes later on in the game. Iheanacho is delighted with his contribution to Brenda Rodgers side pursuit to make Champions League football next season. Iheanacho has bagged seven goals, including his strike against Brighton and Hove Albion on Saturday, and provided four assists in 26 appearances across all competitions. With the Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr set to make public his list of players for the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying games against Benin Republic and Lesotho this week, Iheanacho is one of the sure bets to be on the roaster.
