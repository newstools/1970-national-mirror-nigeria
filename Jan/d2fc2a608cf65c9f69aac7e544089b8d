 Super Eagles forward, Victor Osimhen will not feature for Napoli in the Europa League round of 32 second leg clash against Granada at the Diego Maradona stadium in Naples due to his current health condition. The 22-year-old, who had earlier missed 94 days due to a shoulder injury and Covid-19 collapsed on the pitch during Napoli’s 4-2 defeat against Atalanta and was rushed to Bergamo’s Papa Giovanni Hospital last weekend. The Azzurri’s have been depleted due to injury to key players including the likes of Faouzi Ghoulam, Diego Demme, Elseid Hysaj, Kostas Manolas and Hirving Lozano and Napoli manager Gennaro Gattuso is hoping Dries Mertens can contribute from the bench in their Europa League tie against Granada on Thursday. “Koulibaly and Ghoulam were already available against Atalanta, and tomorrow they will be there. Osimhen is not available. Demme and Hysaj are not ready to play yet,” he said. “Mertens will start on the bench tomorrow. He can play for 20-25 minutes. He spent a long time on the sidelines. We’ll see how much space we can give him tomorrow.” Granada hold a 2-0 advantage from the first leg but Napoli will be hoping to progress into the round of 16 win a comprehensive 3-0 win at the Diego Maradona stadium.
