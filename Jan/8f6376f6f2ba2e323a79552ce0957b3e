 Leader of Living Faith Church, Bishop David Oyedepo has cautioned his members against taking the COVID19 vaccine. According to Oyedepo, the vaccine is deadly because it has not been duly tested. He spoke at the 40th-anniversary thanksgiving service of the church in the Ota Cathedral in Ogun State over the weekend. In his words: “Let me warn you against this deadly thing circulated round the country, because it has not been duly tested. An elder of this church, who works with the World Health Organisation, confirmed this, thanking me for always speaking the truth about the authenticity of the COVID-19 vaccine,” “What an insult! What an assault! Nobody has the right to enforce vaccination on you, and anybody cannot terminate your employment because you refuse to take the vaccine, my God will show up (for you). Did I tell anyone I am sick? Don’t let anyone harass you into doing what you don’t want to do” “They wanted Africa dead. I heard them say it. When we didn’t die as they proposed, they brought out this vaccination scheme. You need to hear their proclamation that Africa will lack spaces to bury corpses. But, today, reverse is the case. Africa has the least casualty among all the other continents of the world” “A generation where people are forced to take vaccines. It is inhuman; it is immoral sir. I’m not a lawyer, but I do not think it is legal. You can’t come to my house and want to give me injections. “On what? Did I invite you? They are confused. But the church has the answer. Did you see any outbreak of virus here? How will it enter the gate? Will it come through the air?
