 Forgotten Super Eagles star John Ogu has targeted new club in the January transfer window. The 32-year-old Nigeria international has been without a club since leaving Saudi Arabia outfit Al-Adalah FC six months ago due to coronavirus which forced football activities to a hiatus and saw his contract terminated.
