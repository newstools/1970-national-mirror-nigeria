It’s Africa Day today May 25, 2021! Africa Day is a day when Africans across the globe celebrate and acknowledge the successes of the Organisation of African Unity (AU) from its creation on May 25, 1963, in the fight against colonialism and apartheid, as well as the progress that Africa has made while reflecting upon the common challenges that the continent faces. This year OSG will be celebrating the progress of liberation movements on the African continent with these nostalgic old school jams that rocked our childhood. We honestly don’t know any African person that doesn’t love this song. Although, we do not understand what she was saying, Vulindlela was a hit in the 90’s. The sound and originality is second to none! Rest on Brenda Fassie!  This song was so famous that it was played in Chile, Latin América, in 1997. It was the song of the main tittles for a famous Chilean Soap Opera called “Oro verde” (Green Gold) and was actually translated into Spanish. We all screamed ‘ori ori o’ as youngsters.  Coupe bibamba is a blast from our past! This song was the jam at every birthday party! Everyone loved and vibed to it. So many dancing competitions were centered around this song.  It was Koffi Olomide or nothing then! There’s no way you were alive in Africa during the 90’s and don’t know this song!  If your mum didn’t play this song while growing up then please grow up again. Lol. No Jokes. This right here is a classic! God bless you Yvonne!  If you don’t know African Queen, please go and get born again!  The national anthem of Africa! Take it or leave it.  Nostalgic! Benin republic blessed us with this wedding classic!
