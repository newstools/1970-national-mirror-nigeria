 Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has confirmed that Odion Ighalo will get a chance against his former club, Watford this weekend in the FA Cup. The 31-year old Nigerian striker has found it even more difficult to get playing time with the Red Devils with the arrival of Uruguay forward Edison Cavani. But Ighalo has been assured he would have a part to play against Watford this weekend.  “Odion, it’s special for him against Watford, he will be involved, he’s in the squad, he’s been training really well, he was the top scorer in round-robin we just finished,” Solskjaer told a press conference on Friday. “He’s not lost any of his quality, it’s been difficult for him to be out of the squad as many times because he did really well up until the summer.  “This season he’s not had as many opportunities and not let himself down as a professional and a human being. He’s always a positive influence in the dressing room. Hopefully, I don’t need to put him on that we need goals, but hopefully, he can join in.” Ighalo has only been featured just once in the Premier League this season. Post Views:
