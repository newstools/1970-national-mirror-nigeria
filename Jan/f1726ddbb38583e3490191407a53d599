 After finally seeing their unbeaten run in the NPFL halted by Plateau United last Friday, Nasarawa United will be hoping to get back on track as they host Enyimba in Lafia in one of the midweek games. The Solid Miners through their Coach Bala Nikyu insist they are determined to return to winning ways again. Just one point separates the two teams, with Enyimba occupying the 2nd position with fifteen points while Nasarawa United sits third with fourteen points, but with superior goals difference. With no injury concern for the Lafia based club, hopes are high to see the Governor A.A. Sule Boys quickly return to the top of the NPFL table as they have been condemned to victory at the expense of the Aba Elephants. Their guests have lost two games on the road, one more than the Solid Miners since the beginning of the 2020/2021 football season, and Nasarawa United are prepared to compound their poor away form when both teams clash Wednesday in Lafia in what promises to be an action-packed clash. Nasarawa United lost 1-3 in the pair’s last meeting in Aba during the 2019/2020 League Season with the travellers conceding 2-0 in Lafia in the return fixture, courtesy of goals from Chinedu Ohanachom and Maigishiri Dauda before the league was aborted. Coach Nikyu believes it’s not the time to get the boys distracted by fabricated opinions by individuals who don’t know the spirit of the team. Shortly after the game against Plateau United in Jos, the Solid Miners’ gaffer had stated that “Enyimba are beatable”, stressing that “Enyimba are not Manchester or Arsenal.” Post Views:
