 Manchester United manager, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted on a possible first start for new signing Amad Diallo in Thursday’s Europa League tie against La Liga side Real Sociedad. However, the Red Devils manager confirmed that Paul Pogba, Scott McTominay, Donny van de Beek and Edinson Cavani will not be available for the encounter. ““They’ll still be missing,” explained Ole to us. “They’ve not joined training so they won’t be ready. no. Paul has been outside on the grass and is starting to step up his recovery but he’s not near the team for this game.” “It’ll be more or less the same squad that we had against Newcastle,” added the boss at his press conference. “Hannibal is injured for about a month. Amad and Shola will, of course, be involved. They are in the squad but I am not going to tell you if they are starting or not.” Manchester United lead 4-0 from the first leg and are expected to rest some first team players with an eye on Sunday’s big clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday.
